## 1.0.11

### Patch Changes

- ec550ce: `@scrivr/docx` — lock the DOCX export base contract AND ship the
  semantic-core default handlers. Replaces the type-only skeleton with a
  real, deterministic pipeline that produces a Word-openable `.docx` out of
  the box. Built so feature PRs (lists, tables, images, hyperlinks,
  track-changes) can add handlers without renegotiating the contract.

  The default handlers cover the StarterKit semantic primitives — paragraph,
  heading (with auto-registered Heading1-6 paragraph styles), hardBreak,
  pageBreak, horizontalRule, codeBlock, and the basic marks (bold, italic,
  underline, strikethrough, code, color, highlight, fontSize, fontFamily).
  Without them an unconfigured editor would export an empty body that Word
  rejects, so they're part of the base, not deferred.

  A new `DocxExport` extension contributes `editor.commands.exportDocx()` +
  an "⬇ DOCX" toolbar button, mirroring the `PdfExport` pattern.

  The base PR ships the pieces that are expensive to change later:

  **Contract (locked)**

  - `DocxNodeHandler(node, children, ctx, meta)` — walker owns recursion and
    passes already-composed child XML in; handlers wrap or position it.
  - `DocxMarkHandler(props, mark, ctx) → DocxRunProps` — marks accumulate
    into a run-property bag, never wrap XML, so `bold(italic(...))` cannot
    produce nested `<w:r>` (invalid OOXML).
  - `DocxRunProps` reserves `trackedInsert`/`trackedDelete` fields. The
    walker intentionally does NOT emit `<w:ins>`/`<w:del>` — track-changes
    XML lands in a dedicated feature PR with author/date/comment-range
    semantics.
  - `DocxExportResult { bytes, diagnostics }` from `exportDocx()` — DOCX
    is inherently lossy, so the API surfaces fidelity warnings from day
    one. `exportDocxBytes()` is the ergonomic alias.
  - `DocxExportError` carries `diagnostics` so fatal failures preserve the
    warnings that preceded them.
  - `options.unsupported: "drop" | "placeholder" | "throw"` and
    `options.fidelity: "strict" | "compatible" | "best-effort"` — value
    types locked even though only `"drop"` and `"compatible"` are honored
    by the base walker (feature PRs branch on these without touching the
    contract).

  **Pipeline**

  - `collect → createContext → onBeforeExport → walk → onBuildTreeComplete
→ finalize / default packager → zip`.
  - Handler layering: built-in defaults → extension `addExports().docx`
    contributions → per-call `options.overrides`.
  - `walkDocument` skips the implicit root, returns body XML; default
    packager wraps it in `<w:document>/<w:body>` plus a US-Letter sectPr.
  - `createDocxContext` exposes producer registries (`styles.getOrCreate`,
    `numbering.getOrCreate`, `rels.addImage/addHyperlink`, `media.add`,
    `diagnostics.warn/error`, `shared.getOrInit`) backed by an internal
    `DocxBuildState` the OPC builder walks.
  - `buildDocxPackage` emits all required OPC parts:
    `[Content_Types].xml`, `_rels/.rels`, `word/document.xml`,
    `word/_rels/document.xml.rels`, `word/styles.xml`, `word/numbering.xml`,
    `word/settings.xml`, plus media parts and extension content-type
    defaults per unique extension.
  - Internal document rels use stable named IDs (`rIdStyles`,
    `rIdNumbering`, `rIdSettings`) so they never collide with user-allocated
    `rId{n}` IDs.

  **Serializer**

  - `xml(name, attrs?, children?)` builder + `serializeXml(root, opts?)`
    with alphabetical attribute ordering for golden-test stability and
    proper XML escaping for both text and attribute values.
  - `xml:space="preserve"` is automatically applied to text runs with edge
    whitespace.

  **Mark merging**

  - `<w:rPr>` children emitted in OOXML spec order (`rStyle`, `rFonts`,
    `b`, `i`, `strike`, `color`, `sz`, `highlight`, `u`).
  - Run-prop conversion: `fontSize` (px) → half-points (×1.5), `color`
    strips leading `#`, `code` mark sets Courier New `rFonts` when no
    explicit `fontFamily`.

  **ZIP**

  - `fflate` (`zipSync`) — small (~8KB), zero deps, browser + Node compatible.
  - `mtime` pinned to the ZIP epoch so identical input produces identical
    bytes (deterministic for content-addressable storage and golden tests).

  **Word compatibility**

  - The walker's "drop" policy now wraps orphan inline children of a
    dropped textblock in `<w:p>` — bare `<w:r>` as a direct child of
    `<w:body>` is invalid OOXML and Word refuses to open the file.
  - `buildDocumentRoot` injects an empty `<w:p/>` when the walked body
    is empty (same reason — Word rejects empty bodies).

  **Tests**

  - 51 unit tests across `xml`, `walker`, `package`, `defaults`,
    `exportDocx`. Walker tests drive a real `ServerEditor` + StarterKit
    schema (no fake nodes / fixtures) — exercises text emission,
    whitespace preservation, mark merging into a single run, missing-mark
    warnings, all three unsupported policies, font-size unit conversion,
    and the reserved track-changes fields (verifies no `<w:ins>`/`<w:del>`
    emission yet).
  - End-to-end test exports a `ServerEditor` doc, unzips the bytes, and
    asserts every required OPC part is present and well-formed.

  Other packages: lockstep version bump, no behavior change.

- ec550ce: DOCX image export — `image` node now exports to `<w:drawing>` with all five
  Scrivr wrap modes mapped to the corresponding OOXML wrap elements. Embedded
  as binary parts under `word/media/`, referenced by document-level rels.

  **Where it lives**

  - `packages/core/src/extensions/built-in/Image.docx.ts` — the extension owns
    its DOCX export shape. Uses LOCAL structural type stand-ins (no runtime
    imports of `@scrivr/docx`) so the dependency direction stays
    one-way (docx → core). The integration test in `@scrivr/docx`
    asserts the local types stay structurally compatible with `DocxContext`.
  - Image extension's `addExports()` returns `{ docx: imageDocxContribution }`.
    StarterKit got a new `addExports()` that aggregates sub-extension
    contributions (format-aware merge: `nodes`/`marks` combine, lifecycle
    hooks chain, `onFinalize` is last-writer-wins) — Image's docx
    contribution now propagates through StarterKit to the export pipeline.

  **Wrap-mode mapping (Scrivr → OOXML)**
  | Scrivr `wrapMode` | OOXML wrapper | Wrap element |
  |-------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
  | `inline` | `<wp:inline>` | (atom inside `<w:r>`) |
  | `square` | `<wp:anchor>` | `<wp:wrapSquare wrapText=…/>` |
  | `top-bottom` | `<wp:anchor>` | `<wp:wrapTopAndBottom/>` |
  | `behind` | `<wp:anchor behindDoc="1">` | `<wp:wrapNone/>` |
  | `front` | `<wp:anchor behindDoc="0">` | `<wp:wrapNone/>` |

  **Pipeline**

  - `onBeforeExport` walks the doc once, collects unique `image.src` values,
    fetches the bytes (data URLs decoded synchronously; http(s) via `fetch`),
    sniffs MIME from magic bytes (PNG / JPEG / GIF / WebP — fallback PNG),
    registers media + rel via `ctx.media.add` / `ctx.rels.addImage`, and
    stores `Map<src, ImageRecord>` under `ctx.shared["docx:images"]`.
  - Sync `image` node handler reads the precomputed record, picks
    `<wp:inline>` for `wrapMode: "inline"` and `<wp:anchor>` for the four
    float modes, with the right wrap element per mode.

  **Unit + position**

  - `pxToEmu(px)` = `round(px × 9525)` (1px @ 96 DPI = 9525 EMU).
  - Anchored position: `xAlign: left | center | right` → `<wp:align>`;
    literal `x` (px) → `<wp:posOffset>` in EMU relative to column; `yOffset`
    (px) → `<wp:posOffset>` relative to paragraph; `margin` (px) → all four
    `dist*` attrs.

  **Base contract tweak**

  - `DocxContext.editor: IBaseEditor` — lifecycle hooks like
    `onBeforeExport` need the doc to walk it for resource precomputation.
    Previously hooks only received `ctx` with no way back to the source.

  **Tests**

  - 8 integration tests across all 5 wrap modes, dedup by src,
    fetch-failure diagnostic, EMU conversion sanity. Mocked `fetch`
    serves a real 1×1 PNG so the bytes survive ZIP encode/decode.

  Other packages: lockstep version bump, no behavior change.

- 19b2879: `@scrivr/docx` — add DOCX import. The package now round-trips: import a
  `.docx` to a ProseMirror `Node` against the editor's schema, edit, and
  re-export with semantic fidelity for everything the playground exercises.

  Same architectural shape as the export side:

  **Contract types in core**

  - `@scrivr/core/exports/docx.ts` is the single source of truth for both
    directions. New: `DocxImports` (blocks/paragraphStyles/marks/inlines +
    lifecycle hooks), `DocxImportContext` (mirror of `DocxContext` with
    `resolveImage` / `resolveHyperlink` instead of `addImage` / `addHyperlink`),
    `DocxBlock` / `DocxInline` / `DocxMark` for the normalized intermediate
    model the parser emits.
  - `addImports()` extension lane added to `Extension`, collected by the
    manager alongside `addExports()`.

  **Two-stage pipeline**

  - **Stage 1 — parser** (`packages/docx/src/import/parser.ts`). OOXML-pure;
    no ProseMirror awareness. Emits `DocxImportModel { blocks: DocxBlock[] }`.
    Tolerates real Word output via allowlists for ignorable metadata
    (bookmarks, `proofErr`, comment markers, `smartTag`, permission ranges).
    Hyperlinks survive as `link` marks carrying relId/anchor/history;
    inline `<w:br w:type="page"/>` splits the surrounding paragraph;
    toggle rPr (b/i/u/strike/...) is normalized via `parseOnOff` so
    `<w:b w:val="false"/>` drops the mark instead of reaching Stage 2.
    Images deep-look for `<a:blip>` to tolerate non-standard drawingML
    nesting and preserve `relativeFrom` on positionH/positionV.
  - **List reconstruction** (between stages) — flat `numPr` paragraphs →
    nested `bulletList > listItem > paragraph` trees. Handles mixed nested
    lists (bullet outer, ordered inner): nested paragraphs with a different
    numId at `ilvl > 0` stay in the same run instead of splitting into
    separate top-level lists.
  - **Stage 2 — transform** (`transform.ts`). Dispatches via extension
    contributions plus per-call overrides. Three dispatch lanes mirror
    export: `blocks[block.type]`, `paragraphStyles[styleId]`,
    `marks[mark.kind]`, plus a new `inlines[inline.type]` lane for images.
    Handlers return real PM `Node` / `Mark` instances — no invented JSON
    shape to drift from ProseMirror.

  **Built-in import handlers (extension owns its import)**

  - Heading — paragraphStyles dispatch for `Heading1`/`Heading2`/`Heading3`.
  - Marks: bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, color, highlight
    (named `val` and hex shading), fontSize (half-points → px),
    fontFamily, link (relId → URL via `ctx.rels.resolveHyperlink`).
  - Image — five wrap modes (`inline` / `square` / `topAndBottom` /
    `behind` / `front`) with rel-resolved src.
  - HorizontalRule — Stage 1 detects Word's empty-paragraph-with-bottom-
    border convention and emits a `horizontalRule` block (matches the
    export side's output shape).
  - CodeBlock, PageBreak, Paragraph fallbacks live in the transform.

  **Media materialization** (`media.ts`)

  - `options.media`: `"data-url"` (default, base64 `data:` URL, works
    everywhere) / `"object-url"` (`URL.createObjectURL(blob)`, browser-only)
    / `"drop"` (emit no `src`, record a diagnostic — caller handles uploads).

  **Unsupported policy honored on both sides**

  - Parser emits `unsupported-docx-element` for any unmodeled body child
    (tables, sdt, etc.) with an explicit ignorable allowlist for harmless
    markup. Transform emits `unsupported-block` / `unsupported-mark` for
    unknown kinds. `importDocx` escalates to `DocxImportError` post-pipeline
    when `options.unsupported === "throw"`. Mirrors export-side semantics:
    any content loss is fatal under `throw`, silent (but diagnosed) under
    `drop`/`placeholder`.

  **`DocxImport` extension** (`packages/docx/src/import/DocxImport.ts`)

  - Toolbar button + file-picker flow. Opens a native `<input type="file">`,
    runs `importDocx`, replaces the editor's doc via
    `tr.replaceWith(0, doc.content.size, …)` — the same pattern the collab
    YBinding uses for hard resets. Browser-only; server callers continue
    to use `importDocx(editor, bytes)` directly.
  - Playground wires the icon (Lucide `FileUp`) into the toolbar `ICON_MAP`
    next to `⬇ DOCX` and registers the extension in both the collab and
    standalone extension lists.

  **Tests**

  - 33 import tests in `import.test.ts`. Round-trips through
    `exportDocxBytes`: build a known doc, serialize → bytes, parse bytes →
    PM `Node`, assert structure. Covers all built-in marks, headings, code
    blocks, page breaks, horizontal rule, bullet/ordered/nested/mixed-nested
    lists, all five image wrap modes (inline + four anchored), drop policy,
    extension dispatch.
  - 4 dedicated tests for code-review fixes: HR round-trip, mixed-nested
    list reconstruction, `unsupported-docx-element` diagnostic, `throw`
    policy escalation.
  - Full `@scrivr/docx` suite at 105 tests (export 72 + import 33).

  Other packages: lockstep version bump, no behavior change.

- 6f5fb5d: `@scrivr/docx` — replace the placeholder README with a proper one. Covers
  installation, in-editor usage via the `DocxImport` / `DocxExport` extensions,
  server-side usage via `importDocx` / `exportDocx` with `ServerEditor`, the
  shared option dials (`unsupported`, `fidelity`, `media`), and how custom
  extensions contribute their own DOCX handlers via `addImports` / `addExports`.

  No code changes — the placeholder text was a leftover from when the package
  was a type-only skeleton.

  Other packages: lockstep version bump, no behavior change.

- 8b3c741: `@scrivr/core` — new `editor.findExtension(name)` API and React
  ribbon sizes itself from `HeaderFooter.options.activeEditingGap`
  (no more parallel magic constant).

  **New public API:**

  ```ts
  const ext = editor.findExtension("headerFooter");
  if (ext) {
    // ext.options is typed as `object` (the manager has no compile-time
    // link from name → option shape); narrow with a runtime guard.
  }
  ```

  Returns the registered `Extension` instance or `null`. Mirrors the
  existing `ExtensionManager.findExtension(name)` it delegates to.
  Useful for cross-package consumers (React adapter hooks, future
  DevTools) that want to read another extension's configured options
  without coupling to its presence.

  **Ribbon now reads its size from the extension config:**

  `useHeaderFooterRibbon` (in `@scrivr/react`) now calls
  `editor.findExtension("headerFooter")` and reads
  `options.activeEditingGap`. The returned hook value exposes
  `ribbonHeight`, which `HeaderFooterRibbon.tsx` uses for both the
  ribbon's CSS `height` and its top offset. The previous hardcoded
  `28` is gone from the React side — the only remaining `28` is a
  defensive fallback for the case where the `HeaderFooter` extension
  is not registered at all (so `findExtension` returns null).

  Change `HeaderFooter.configure({ activeEditingGap: 40 })` and the
  extension's reserved gap _and_ the ribbon's height move together,
  no manual sync.

  Other packages: lockstep version bump, no behavior change.

- 8b3c741: `@scrivr/plugins` — `HeaderFooter` extension is now configurable with
  `activeEditingGap` so consumers can match the reserved gap to the
  height of their editing affordance.

  ```ts
  HeaderFooter.configure({ activeEditingGap: 28 }); // default — matches React HeaderFooterRibbon
  HeaderFooter.configure({ activeEditingGap: 40 }); // custom ribbon at a different height
  HeaderFooter.configure({ activeEditingGap: 0 }); // headless — no UI to reserve for
  ```

  The value acts as a floor on `slot.margin`: smaller user-set margins
  are clamped up at measure time so activating a surface does not push
  body content down. Margins larger than the gap are honored as-is.

  **Where the value lives.** Applied once at layout time inside
  `resolveChrome.measureSlot` and baked into `slot.reservedHeight` +
  `metrics.contentTop`. Every downstream consumer — canvas paint, PDF
  chrome render, anything reading `editor.layout` — reads the same
  baked value. The PDF render side is intentionally pure render and
  has no knob of its own; configuring this option at editor
  construction is the only place the gap is decided.

  **Dual-use editor limitation.** A single browser `Editor` used for
  both interactive editing and PDF export carries one value across
  both modes — the same layout drives both. Configure for the editing
  case (so the ribbon doesn't push content) and accept the same gap
  in the exported PDF. Consumers that need a ribbon-friendly editor
  _and_ a tight printed PDF should run PDF export against a separate
  `ServerEditor` constructed with `activeEditingGap: 0`, sharing the
  same doc JSON. A future per-export override would require a
  layout-pipeline primitive that accepts per-call chrome option
  overrides — deferred until a concrete consumer requests it.

  Default unchanged for React consumers — the `HeaderFooterRibbon`
  remains 28px tall, the extension defaults to 28, and the React
  hook offsets the ribbon by `-28`. All three locations are
  cross-referenced in code comments so a custom ribbon at a different
  height has clear instructions.

  Other packages: lockstep version bump, no behavior change.

- 8b3c741: `@scrivr/plugins` — header/footer ribbon no longer pushes body content
  down when activated.

  Previously the layout reserved the slot's configured `margin` (default
  12px) as the gap between header content and body. When the user clicked
  into the header, the React ribbon (28px tall) needed more room than the
  gap could fit — `policyWithLiveSurface` widened the margin to 28 on the
  fly, recomputing the band's reserved height and shifting body content
  down by ~16px. Clicking out reversed it. The shift was jarring.

  Fix — always reserve at least ribbon-height for the gap at measure time,
  inside `resolveChrome.measureSlot`. The body now sits at the same
  position whether or not a surface is active; the ribbon simply appears
  in space that was already there. The active-time clamp in
  `policyWithLiveSurface` is gone — the function only updates the live
  slot's content now.

  Behavior delta — a header/footer with `margin < 28` is silently floored
  to 28 at measure time (no API change; the stored value is preserved).
  Documents that already used `margin >= 28` are unaffected. The slight
  extra whitespace below tight headers is the cost of stable body
  positioning.

  Other packages: lockstep version bump, no behavior change.

- a749a3c: `@scrivr/core` — lift ingestion-time normalization from `ServerEditor`
  up to `BaseEditor` so the browser `Editor` benefits too.

  Previously `new Editor({ content: jsonFromAi })` only got URL safety
  on the initial doc; node-ID assignment and table repair waited for the
  first transaction to fire the `UniqueId` and `tableIntegrityPlugin`.
  A consumer who constructed an editor and immediately serialised
  without typing anything saw an un-normalized snapshot.

  Now `BaseEditor`'s constructor routes the initial doc through
  `normalizeDocument` — JSON, markdown, or extension-supplied default —
  so every initial state is URL-safe, table-repaired, and fully
  ID-stamped before the first transaction. `editor.lastNormalizeResult`
  exposes the same `{ doc, warnings, fingerprint, changed }` shape that
  `ServerEditor.setContent` already populated.

  `normalizeDocument(input, options)` also now accepts a parsed
  ProseMirror `Node` (not just JSON), so callers that already have a
  Node — including `BaseEditor`'s own constructor after the markdown
  parse — skip the wasted JSON round-trip.

  Behaviour delta — the browser `Editor` now also stamps node IDs and
  repairs tables on initial load. Symmetric with the server side; the
  in-editor plugins (`UniqueId`, `tableIntegrityPlugin`) still run on
  subsequent transactions and find no work to do because the constructor
  already handled it. Full suite green (core 1105/1105, plugins 328 + 5
  skipped, typecheck 13/13).

  Other packages: lockstep version bump, no behavior change.

- a749a3c: `@scrivr/core` — extract pure-function normalization primitives from the
  plugin layer in preparation for a public `normalizeDocument` entry point.

  **New core exports** (`@scrivr/core`):

  - `assignBlockIds(doc, { generate? })` — pure function that stamps a
    stable `nodeId` onto every block whose schema declares the attr but
    whose current value is `null`. Returns the same `Node` reference when
    nothing needed assignment (fast-path), so callers can detect a no-op
    cheaply. Mirrors the shape of `sanitizeDocUrls`.
  - `planBlockIdAssignments(doc, { generate? })` — sibling for
    transaction-grain callers. Returns one `{ pos, attrs }` entry per
    block that needs an ID, so the caller can emit one `setNodeMarkup`
    step per block instead of a whole-doc replace (better grain for
    history and collab).
  - `normalizeTablesDoc(doc, schema)` — doc-level wrapper around the
    existing `normalizeTables(state)` so table-integrity repair is
    reachable without materialising an `EditorState`. Same fast-path
    semantics.

  **`@scrivr/plugins`** — `UniqueId` plugin no longer carries its own
  walk. `appendTransaction` calls `planBlockIdAssignments(newState.doc)`
  and translates the result into `setNodeMarkup` steps. Single source of
  truth for the "which blocks need IDs?" predicate, so server-side and
  AI ingestion paths apply identical semantics to the live editor.

  Behaviour delta: none. All existing tests pass unchanged
  (core 1085/1085, plugins 328 + 5 skipped). Strictly a refactor that
  makes the upcoming `normalizeDocument` and `diffDocuments` public APIs
  possible without duplicating logic across packages.

  Other packages: lockstep version bump, no behavior change.

- a749a3c: `@scrivr/core` — ingestion-time `normalizeDocument` and `ServerEditor`
  wire-up.

  **New public API**

  ```ts
  import { normalizeDocument } from "@scrivr/core";

  const result = normalizeDocument(jsonFromAi, {
    schema: editor.manager.schema,
    // optional knobs
    mode: "repair", // or "strict" — strict throws on bounds breach
    assignIds: true, // default — stamp nodeId on blocks missing one
    generate: () => uuid(), // override the ID generator (deterministic in tests)
    maxNodes: 5000, // bounds check
    maxDepth: 50,
  });

  // result.doc         — normalized PM Node
  // result.warnings    — per-stage diagnostics (urls-sanitized, tables-normalized,
  //                       ids-assigned, bounds-exceeded)
  // result.fingerprint — FNV-1a 8-hex-char hash, deterministic per doc shape
  // result.changed     — true when normalization mutated the input
  ```

  Pipeline composes the existing primitives in one pass:

  1. `schema.nodeFromJSON(input)` — schema validation
  2. bounds check (maxNodes / maxDepth)
  3. `sanitizeDocUrls` — URL allow-list
  4. `normalizeTablesDoc` — table integrity (gridSpan / vMerge / grid)
  5. `assignBlockIds` — stable `nodeId` on every id-bearing block
  6. fingerprint over a deterministic stringification of `doc.toJSON()`

  Warnings are aggregate per stage (`{ code, message, count? }`) — enough
  for an AI server-side review pipeline to decide "did the model output
  something that needed repair?" without diffing two trees.

  **`ServerEditor.setContent` now routes through `normalizeDocument`**.
  The previous standalone `sanitizeDocUrls` call is gone; the same URL
  gate still runs as one stage of the new pipeline, plus table repair
  and ID assignment that previously only happened inside a live editor
  transaction. The result lives on `editor.lastNormalizeResult` for
  consumers that want to inspect warnings (e.g. reject AI output
  containing `urls-sanitized`).

  **Behaviour delta** — `ServerEditor.setContent` now also stamps node
  IDs and repairs tables on initial load instead of waiting for the
  first transaction. This brings server-side ingestion to parity with
  the live editor (where the `UniqueId` and table-integrity plugins
  were already doing it incrementally). Existing tests pass unchanged
  (core 1100/1100, plugins 328 + 5 skipped).

  Other packages: lockstep version bump, no behavior change.

- 65cafa2: `@scrivr/docx` — first public release. Dropped `private: true`, aligned
  version (`0.0.6` → `1.0.10`) with the lockstep version of the other
  `@scrivr/*` packages, and added the missing publish metadata (author,
  repository.directory, homepage, bugs, keywords, publishConfig). The
  package now joins the changeset `fixed` group so future releases keep
  all `@scrivr/*` packages in lockstep.

  Why now: the DOCX round-trip (export PR #92 + import PR #94) shipped two
  weeks ago and the demo has been exercising it. The package is ready to
  ship to npm; the previous independent `0.0.x` versioning track and
  `private: true` flag were holdovers from when only the skeleton existed.

  No code or behavior changes — purely packaging metadata.

## 1.0.10

### Patch Changes

- 6d6f642: `@scrivr/core` — new `addPageConfig?(): PageConfig | undefined` extension
  lane. Extensions can now contribute page dimensions, margins, and the
  pageless toggle through the same first-class hook pattern used for nodes,
  marks, page chrome, etc. `ExtensionManager.buildPageConfig()` resolves the
  config by iterating the lane rather than looking extensions up by name —
  the manager no longer hardcodes `"pagination"` or `"starterKit"`.

  Behavior changes:

  - `Pagination` extension now implements `addPageConfig()` returning its
    configured `PageConfig` options.
  - `StarterKit` implements `addPageConfig()` reading its nested
    `pagination` option. Returns `undefined` when unset (so a downstream
    `Pagination.configure(...)` wins cleanly), the partial-merged config
    when set to an object, and `undefined` again when set to `false`.
  - Multi-provider warning fires when two extensions contribute non-undefined
    page configs — same pattern as the initial-doc lane.
  - The two `Extension.options` runtime predicates (`isPageConfig`,
    `readStarterKitPagination`) that existed to dodge `as` casts on
    `unknown` option lookups are gone — the typed lane removes the need.

  The `[StarterKit, Pagination.configure(usLetter)]` user pattern continues
  to resolve to `usLetter`. Bare `[StarterKit]` continues to render at
  `defaultPageConfig` via Editor's existing fallback chain.

  Future: when page config moves to `doc.attrs.pageSettings` (see
  `project_page_config_to_docattrs` memory — collaborative page settings,
  ruler-driven margin drags), the same `addPageConfig` lane stays in place
  and the extension just sources from `state.doc.attrs.pageSettings`
  instead of `this.options`. No manager-side rewiring needed.

  Other packages: lockstep version bump, no behavior change.

- 1db8abc: `@scrivr/core` — extension authors now get a `console.warn` whenever one
  extension silently overrides another's node, mark, keymap binding, command,
  input handler, markdown parser token, or markdown serializer rule (per kind
  or lane). Each warning names the previous and new contributor so accidental
  typos that shadow built-ins surface immediately. Doc attrs and surface owners
  remain `throw` on collision; the new warn lane covers everything else where
  override is sometimes intentional but always worth knowing about.

  Additionally:

  - New baseline warning when an extension overrides ProseMirror's required
    `doc` or `text` node — points at `addDocAttrs()` as the supported path for
    doc-level data.
  - New warning when more than one extension provides an initial document
    (e.g. `Collaboration` + `DefaultContent` stacking).
  - `buildSchemaFromPhase1` no longer mutates its input contributions object.
  - `Phase1SchemaContributions` now types `nodes` / `marks` as `NodeSpec` /
    `MarkSpec` instead of `object`, removing two `as` casts from the schema
    merge step.
  - `buildPageConfig` reads `Extension.options` via runtime predicates
    (`isPageConfig`, `readStarterKitPagination`) instead of unchecked `as`
    casts.

  Internal refactor: nodes, marks, keymap, commands, input handlers, markdown
  parser tokens, markdown serializer rules, and doc-attrs all share one
  `mergeContributions<T>()` helper with a `"warn"` / `"throw"` policy.

  Other packages: lockstep version bump, no behavior change.

- 2f74d3e: `@scrivr/core` — new first-class `HardBreak` extension, individually
  importable as `import { HardBreak } from "@scrivr/core"` and matching
  the shape of the other built-ins (Bold, Heading, HorizontalRule, etc.).

  Previously the `hardBreak` node lived bundled inside the `Document`
  extension and the `Shift-Enter` keymap was hardcoded in `BaseEditing`.
  That made it impossible to opt out cleanly, to swap in a different
  implementation, or to disable just the shortcut while keeping the node.

  The new extension owns:

  - The `hardBreak` inline-leaf node spec
  - The `Shift-Enter` keymap (gated by `shortcut: boolean` option)
  - The `insertHardBreak()` command (`editor.commands.insertHardBreak()`)
  - The markdown serializer rule (with trailing-break suppression — a
    trailing hardBreak no longer leaks a stray `\\\n` into the output)
  - The markdown PARSER token mapping (new — closes a long-standing
    asymmetry where the old `Document` extension serialized hard breaks
    but couldn't parse them back in, throwing `Token type "hardbreak"
not supported` on any markdown input containing one)

  `Document` shrinks to contributing only the baseline `text` markdown
  serializer rule (kept here because every doc has text nodes and
  prosemirror-markdown needs an explicit serializer for them).
  `BaseEditing` drops its Shift-Enter binding entirely — Backspace,
  Delete, Mod-a, and arrow navigation are still owned there.

  `StarterKit` gains a new option:

  ```ts
  StarterKit.configure({
    hardBreak: false, // drop entirely
  });

  StarterKit.configure({
    hardBreak: { shortcut: false }, // keep node + command, drop Shift-Enter
  });
  ```

  Default behavior is unchanged: `StarterKit` includes `HardBreak` with
  the Shift-Enter shortcut bound, so existing apps see no observable
  difference except that `ServerEditor({ content: "alpha\\\nbeta" })`
  now parses correctly instead of throwing.

  19 tests cover the extension surface (node shape, keymap presence /
  opt-out, command behaviour against a real `ServerEditor`, markdown
  parse + serialize + full roundtrip including the trailing-break edge
  case), regression guards proving `Document` and `BaseEditing` no
  longer own this responsibility, and `StarterKit` integration through
  all three option shapes (`undefined`, `false`, `{ shortcut: false }`).

- 6c1945a: Collaborative headers & footers (Phase 5 of the header-footer plan).

  **`@scrivr/core`** — `ExtensionManager` exposes `getDocAttrNames()` and
  `getDocAttrOwners()`, sourced from the doc-attr ownership map already built
  during schema construction. `IBaseEditor` grows `getDocAttrNames(): string[]`
  so headless consumers (collab bindings, future audit tooling) can read the
  declared-attr whitelist without touching schema internals. `BaseEditor`
  implements the delegation, inherited by `Editor` and `ServerEditor`. Pure
  additive surface.

  **`@scrivr/plugins`** — `YBinding` now syncs `doc.attrs` across peers via a
  sibling `Y.Map("prose_doc_attrs")` keyed by attr name with `DocAttrEnvelope`
  values (`{ localSeq, value }`). Header/footer policy edits propagate between
  peers, late joiners adopt the room's current policy on `markSynced`, and
  the `Y.UndoManager` scope grows to cover the attrs map so Cmd-Z reverses a
  policy change like any other document edit. The whitelist comes from
  `editor.getDocAttrNames()` so only declared attrs cross the wire; undeclared
  keys and malformed envelopes are silently dropped. Yjs remains authoritative
  for conflict resolution — `localSeq` is a local dedup hint, not a tiebreaker.

  `HeaderFooterRibbon` placement fix (it now sits above the header band rather
  than overlapping the painted header content).

  **`@scrivr/react`** — `HeaderFooterRibbon` + `useHeaderFooterRibbon` updated
  to match the new ribbon-placement contract.

  **`@scrivr/export`, `@scrivr/export-pdf`, `@scrivr/export-docx`,
  `@scrivr/export-markdown`** — lockstep version bump only; no behavior change.

- 4c2dd5e: `@scrivr/core` — regression coverage for `PasteTransformer` and the
  markdown ingestion path against real-world hostile inputs. No
  functional changes; documents what the existing pipeline already does.

  `PasteTransformer.test.ts` gains five new describe-blocks asserting
  the cleaning contract on every output doc:

  - **drops script and style elements** — `<script>`, `<style>`, nested
    scripts inside divs
  - **strips event-handler attributes** — `onerror`, `onclick`,
    `onmouseover`, body-level `onload`
  - **rejects forbidden URL schemes** — `javascript:`, `data:text/html`,
    `vbscript:`, `file:`, plus obfuscation variants (mixed case,
    whitespace prefix, HTML-entity-encoded scheme)
  - **ignores embedded objects** — `iframe`, `object`, `embed`, `form`
  - **SVG content model** — `<svg><script>`, `<svg onload>`

  Plus a deeply-nested-wrappers case proving the cleaning walks through
  any depth.

  `parseMarkdown.test.ts` (new file) covers the markdown ingestion path
  the constructor uses when given `content: "..."`. With
  `MarkdownIt({ html: false })` raw HTML in markdown source survives as
  literal text — safe in every render target the framework supports
  (canvas paints glyphs, exports use textContent / structured writers,
  DOM renderers are required to use textContent per the security model).
  The structural and URL invariants are asserted; the literal-text
  behavior is documented as intentional.

  Each describe-block reads as a normal regression test for how the
  component behaves under hostile input — not as a labelled "security
  suite" that would advertise the threat surface or frame defenses as
  separable from the features they protect.

  Comment cleanup along the way: removed temporal references from
  `Document.ts` ("hardBreak lives in its own HardBreak extension as of
  the extraction PR") and `HardBreak.ts` ("Previously bundled inside
  the Document extension. Extracted so it...") that coupled the code
  to specific PR work.

- fcd166b: **Popover UX — close on editor focus loss.** Floating menus (bubble menu,
  slash menu, link popover, image menu, floating block menu, AI suggestion
  popover, track-changes popover) now hide when the editor loses DOM focus
  to something that isn't the popover itself. Previously they stayed
  anchored to invisible selection state when the user clicked into a sidebar,
  the browser address bar, or another window — the classic "feels weird"
  artifact of subscribing only to PM state changes (DOM blur leaves the
  selection untouched).

  New `subscribeEditorFocusOutside(editor, onHide, { getPopoverElement? })`
  helper in `@scrivr/core/menus` is the shared signal source. Defers the
  hide one microtask so a click _into_ a popover (which blurs the editor
  then focuses an input inside) settles before the check runs.

  Popover detection, in priority:

  1. `getPopoverElement()` — accessor returning the popover's root DOM node.
     Each `createXMenu` controller now accepts this, and each React hook
     threads its `rootRef.current` through. Bulletproof for internal
     popovers — no marker attribute required.
  2. `[data-scrivr-popover="<menu-name>"]` ancestor — fallback for vanilla
     / third-party popovers that don't have a ref accessor. The seven React
     components ship with a named marker (`bubble-menu`, `link-popover`,
     etc.) as defense in depth and to keep DOM inspection self-documenting.

  Header/footer surfaces are intentionally excluded — they're a persistent
  editing mode, not a popover.

  **`cx` utility upgrade.** The class-name combiner in `@scrivr/react/utils`
  now accepts strings, numbers, falsy values, nested arrays, and conditional
  dictionaries in addition to the previous string-only positional form. The
  eight existing callers continue to work unchanged (they pass positional
  strings, which the new shape handles identically). New shapes available:

  ```ts
  cx("btn", isActive && "btn-active"); // already worked
  cx("btn", { "btn-active": isActive }); // NEW — conditional dict
  cx(["base", flagged && "flag"]); // NEW — nested arrays
  cx("col-", count); // NEW — numbers
  ```

  Return contract preserved: `string | undefined`. Tailwind utility-class
  conflicts are NOT auto-merged (pull in `tailwind-merge` for that).

  **React test runner bootstrap.** `@scrivr/react`'s `"test": "true"`
  placeholder is replaced with real vitest + a node-environment config.
  First occupant: 15 tests for the upgraded `cx` covering positional
  strings, conditional dicts, nested arrays, numbers, dedup order, and the
  documented Tailwind non-merge limitation. Removes one item from the
  stable-1.x roadmap's "React adapter has no regression tests" gap.

  Other packages: lockstep version bump, no behavior change.

- b61e408: `@scrivr/core` — central URL allow-list at the document boundary. PR 2
  of the pre-1.x security baseline (`SECURITY.md` shipped in PR 1).

  Adds `safeUrl(value)` in `@scrivr/core/model`. Returns the trimmed input
  when the value is safe to store, `null` when it isn't. Allow-list:
  `http`, `https`, `mailto`, `tel`, fragment-only (`#anchor`), and
  relative URLs. Everything else — `javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`,
  `file:`, unknown custom schemes — returns `null`. Strips ASCII control
  characters before validating so the classic `"java\x00script:"`
  obfuscation can't slip past a naive prefix check. Trims whitespace.
  Case-insensitive scheme match per RFC 3986. Defensive against non-string
  input so callers reading from `unknown`-typed sources (collab apply,
  parseDOM attribute getters) can pass values through without their own
  type guard.

  Wired at every URL ingestion point in `Link` and `Image`:

  - `Link` parseDOM — `<a href="javascript:...">click</a>` → mark dropped,
    text preserved (returning `false` from `getAttrs` is the canonical
    "drop this match" signal)
  - `Link.setLink` command — prompt validated; unsafe input is a no-op
  - `Link.setLinkHref` command — returns `false` on unsafe href; safe
    href stored normalised
  - `Image` parseDOM — `<img src="javascript:...">` → node dropped entirely
  - `Image.insertImage` command — prompt validated; unsafe input is a no-op

  **JSON-load gate** — addresses the codex-flagged gap that parseDOM-only
  validation leaves: `schema.nodeFromJSON` bypasses parseDOM entirely, so
  a saved doc on disk with `link.attrs.href = "javascript:..."` would
  round-trip unchanged.

  New `sanitizeDocUrls(doc, schema)` walks a constructed PM doc and
  applies the same allow-list to URL-bearing attrs. Image with unsafe
  `src` → node dropped. Link mark with unsafe `href` → mark stripped,
  text and co-occurring marks preserved. Cheap idempotent fast-path: a
  clean doc returns the same `Node` reference, no allocation.

  Wired at both raw-JSON ingestion sites:

  - `BaseEditor` constructor — covers `content: json`, `content: "markdown"`,
    and extension-supplied `addInitialDoc()` (like `DefaultContent`) in
    one place
  - `ServerEditor.setContent(json)` — runtime doc replacement

  **Out of scope** (deliberate, separate PRs):

  - **Collab Y→PM apply** — `yXmlFragmentToProseMirrorRootNode` bypasses
    both parseDOM and constructor init. Adversarial-peer trust is already
    documented in `SECURITY.md` as an app-layer concern (auth, validation,
    potentially E2EE). A post-apply walker is a separate design.
  - **Hand-rolled raw-node transactions** (`editor.applyTransaction(tr.replaceWith(0, 5, rawNode))`)
    — covered if the node came through commands, not if hand-rolled. A
    doc-wide transaction filter would catch it but trades for per-keystroke
    overhead. Defer.

  **Bonus cleanup** (the user's no-`as` rule extends here):

  - New `getNodeAttrs<K>` / `getMarkAttrs<K>` typed accessors in
    `@scrivr/core/model`. Look up `NodeAttributes[K]` / `MarkAttributes[K]`
    augmentations to give extension authors typed `attrs.src` /
    `attrs.href` access. Single `as` lives inside the helper behind a
    runtime kind check — no scattered casts at usage sites.
  - Augmented `NodeAttributes.image` (existing `MarkAttributes.link` was
    already in place from a prior PR).
  - Removed 4 scattered `as` casts from `Link.ts` and `Image.ts`. Zero
    type assertions remain in either file.

  **Tests** (43 new):

  - 25 fuzz tests on `safeUrl` covering all the agreed obfuscation
    scenarios from the security baseline plan
  - 11 tests on `sanitizeDocUrls` covering helper behaviour + ServerEditor
    constructor + setContent integration
  - 7 integration tests on `Link` covering parseDOM rejection and command
    rejection

  All 12 monorepo typecheck tasks pass. All 11 test tasks pass.

- 6d49fe0: **Repo:** add `SECURITY.md` — first PR of the pre-1.x security baseline.

  Establishes the disclosure surface and the trust model so external
  researchers know how to report vulnerabilities responsibly and app
  authors know where the framework's defended surface ends.

  Disclosure channel is GitHub Security Advisories (private, encrypted,
  CVE-integrated). Coordinated-disclosure window is 90 days. Acknowledge
  within 3 business days, substantive response within 10.

  Explicitly out-of-scope (so reporters don't burn time and app authors
  know to handle these at their layer):

  - **Extensions are trusted code** — same model as TipTap / ProseMirror /
    CodeMirror / Slate. No sandbox. Audit extensions like dependencies.
  - **Collaborative peers can mutate the document** — Scrivr enforces
    schema invariants but not authorisation. Adversarial-peer scenarios
    need app-level permissioning, validation, and potentially E2EE.
  - **AI prompt injection** — defended at the prompt layer + accept-time
    UX, not the suggestion overlay primitive.
  - **DoS via pathological input** — documented as recommended app-level
    limits today; hard guards in core planned for 1.1+.

  States the load-bearing invariant: **storage-safe forever**. Anything
  that enters the ProseMirror JSON document must be safe to render
  through any future surface (DOM a11y mirror, PDF, DOCX, exports).
  Validation happens at ingestion time, not render time.

  No code changes — lockstep patch bump only so the policy is visible
  in every published package's release notes.

  **Action required by the repo owner before this policy is real:** enable
  "Private vulnerability reporting" in repo Settings → Security → Code
  security and analysis. Without it the disclosure URL 404s for non-
  maintainers.

### Patch Changes

- dd3f3d6: `@scrivr/plugins`: drop the hand-rolled `TestAiEditor` `IEditor` stub. The
  ai-suggestion test suites now drive a real headless `ServerEditor` (wrapped
  in a thin `AiTestEditor` subclass that adds test sugar — `showSuggestion`,
  `apply`, `reject`, `text`, `suggestionState`). The 110-LOC blob of
  `as never` view stubs (canvas, layout, surfaces, full SelectionController)
  is gone — the test driver is now a real editor with the actual minimal
  schema + `aiSuggestionPlugin` + `trackChangesPlugin` + `history()` wired
  through `ServerEditor`'s extension lifecycle.

  To make this possible, three public function signatures widen from
  `IEditor` to `IBaseEditor`:

  - `showAiSuggestion(editor: IBaseEditor, …)`
  - `applyAiSuggestion(editor: IBaseEditor, …)`
  - `rejectAiSuggestion(editor: IBaseEditor, …)`

  These functions only use `getState` + `applyTransaction` — both on
  `IBaseEditor`. Backwards-compatible: any existing caller passing a
  browser `Editor` still satisfies the broader requirement.

  `subscribeToAiSuggestions` also widens to `IBaseEditor`. Its internal
  `activate(blockId)` callback used to call `editor.selection.moveCursorTo`
  unconditionally; it now uses a type-predicate guard (`hasSelectionApi`)
  so view-bound editors keep moving the cursor while headless editors
  skip the no-op-on-headless cursor move. No `as` cast — the guard returns
  a TypeScript type predicate (`editor is IBaseEditor & Pick<IEditor,
"selection">`).

  Other packages: no runtime / API change — bumps included for lockstep
  versioning.

- 0a17632: `@scrivr/core`: drop the static `model/schema.ts` `export const schema`
  and the `model/state.ts` (`createEditorState`, `createEditorStateFromJSON`)
  factories. Both were drifting out of sync with what the production editor
  actually builds — `Editor` and `ServerEditor` construct their schema
  dynamically from extensions (`StarterKit` adds `paragraph.dataTracked`,
  `paragraph.nodeId`, etc.; `TrackChanges` from `@scrivr/plugins` adds
  `trackedInsert` / `trackedDelete` marks) and the static schema couldn't
  keep up.

  **Stability note (beta `0.x`):** the removed surfaces below were technically
  reachable through `@scrivr/core` but were never part of the documented public
  API — `Editor` / `ServerEditor` / `StarterKit` (the documented entry points)
  do not consume them, and they had drifted out of sync with the runtime
  schema. They are removed as internal cleanup. Per the project's beta
  versioning rule (`feedback_changeset_patch_only`) the lockstep bump stays
  `patch`; any external consumer reaching past the documented surface should
  migrate as described below.

  Migration story:

  - The `schema` runtime value, `NodeTypeName` type, `MarkTypeName` type,
    `createEditorState`, `createEditorStateFromJSON`, and the
    `model/schema.ts` + `model/state.ts` modules themselves are removed from
    the package. The `EditorState` type re-export now comes from
    `prosemirror-state` directly. Build a live schema with
    `getSchema([StarterKit, …])` (or `buildStarterKitContext()` in tests) —
    that's what the production editor uses.
  - `model/commands.ts` had ~110 LOC of schema-using helpers (`toggleBold`,
    `toggleItalic`, `toggleUnderline`, `toggleStrikethrough`, `setFontSize`,
    `setFontFamily`, `setColor`, `applyUndo`, `applyRedo`, `splitBlock`,
    `applyToggleMark`) that were never imported in production — each
    extension already exposes its equivalent via `addCommands()` (Bold,
    Italic, FontSize, History, …). All removed. The surviving exports
    (`insertText`, `deleteSelection`, `deleteBackward`, `deleteForward`)
    power `InputBridge` / `PasteTransformer` / `BaseEditing` and don't
    reference any schema.
  - Test consumers of the static schema now build it locally per file via
    `buildStarterKitContext()` (existing helper) or `getSchema([StarterKit])`
    — same StarterKit-built source the runtime editor uses. The describes
    that need `schema` directly (e.g. for `align`-specific attrs) declare
    their own `const { schema } = buildStarterKitContext()` at the describe
    top.

  `@scrivr/plugins`:

  - ai-suggestion test fixture: the `AiTestEditor` (introduced in PR #81)
    now extends `ServerEditor` and wires the production `StarterKit` +
    `TrackChanges` extensions through it. The custom `nodeSpecs` /
    `markSpecs` / `TestSchemaExtension` blob is gone — the test driver runs
    on the same schema and plugins that production runs on.
  - `TrackChanges.onEditorReady` widens `editor: IEditor` to
    `editor: IBaseEditor` and uses a `hasOverlayApi(editor)` type-predicate
    guard to no-op overlay registration on headless editors. Browser-path
    behaviour is unchanged. Mirrors the existing guards in
    `HeaderFooterController` / `HeaderFooter` and the
    `subscribeToAiSuggestions` guard from PR #81. One of the seven
    extensions documented in `todo_extension_oneditorready_guard.md`.

  No runtime behaviour change in the browser path. Test surfaces reduced
  by 25 tests (8 from `state.test.ts`, 5 from dropped commands describes,
  12 from `schema.test.ts`) — coverage of the removed code is replaced by
  the production extensions' own tests.

  Other packages: no runtime / API change — bumps included for lockstep
  versioning.

- ebd52d1: `@scrivr/core` + `@scrivr/plugins`: drop the `_`-prefix on the remaining
  underscore-tagged members — interface methods, cross-class internal API,
  and layout shape fields. Completes the underscore sweep started in the
  previous release.

  **Breaking** (BUT pre-1.0 / beta, no external consumers known beyond the
  in-repo plugins which migrate in this same PR):

  - `IBaseEditor._applyTransaction(tr)` → `IBaseEditor.applyTransaction(tr)`.
    The previous public `applyTransaction(tr)` wrapper that just delegated to
    `_applyTransaction` is removed — there's now a single canonical method.
    Plugins (`YBinding`, `AiToolkit`, `ai-suggestion`, `header-footer`) and
    app code that called `editor._applyTransaction(tr)` should call
    `editor.applyTransaction(tr)` — same behaviour, no underscore.
  - `SurfaceRegistry._setOwnerMediator()` → `setOwnerMediator()`. Still
    `@internal` — only called by `Editor` during construction.
  - `EditorSurface._committing` → `committing`. Still `@internal` — set by
    `SurfaceRegistry` during commit lifecycle, checked by
    `EditorSurface.dispatch()` to refuse re-entrant dispatch.
  - `DocumentLayout._chromePayloads` → `chromePayloads`. Layout shape field
    read by `TileManager` + written by `PageLayout` + `runMiniPipeline`.
  - Module-scope helpers in `PageLayout` (`_runPipelineDepth`,
    `_runPipelineBody`) and `OverlayRenderer` (`_activeDpr`,
    `_setActiveDpr`) lose their underscores.
  - `Paragraph` extension's module-local `_split` const renamed to
    `splitParagraph`.

  Unused-parameter underscores (`_pageNumber`, `_charMap`, `_event`, …) stay
  — that's TS/ESLint convention, not the same pattern.

  No runtime behaviour change. 1,260 / 1,260 tests pass.

- d85d4af: `@scrivr/core`: drop the `_`-prefix convention on internal class members and
  rely on TypeScript visibility modifiers (`private` / `protected`) instead.
  Touches `BaseEditor`, `Editor`, `ServerEditor`, `EditorSurface`,
  `SurfaceRegistry`, `SelectionController`, `LayoutCoordinator`, `TileManager`,
  `PointerController`, `InputBridge`, `CursorManager`.

  Notable renames:

  - `BaseEditor._state` → `BaseEditor.editorState` (root editor state, distinct
    from `EditorSurface`'s `editorState` and any layout `Flow*` concept).
  - `BaseEditor._readOnly` → `readOnlyValue` (backing field for `get readOnly()`).
  - `BaseEditor._applyState` / `_notifyListeners` / `_fireEditorReady` /
    `_dispatchToActive` / `_getActiveState` / `_buildCommands` → underscore
    dropped.
  - `Editor._onChange` → `onChangeHandler`, `_onFocusChange` →
    `onFocusChangeHandler` (avoid shadowing the constructor option names).
  - `Editor._viewDispatch` → `viewDispatch`, plus theme / debug / raf private
    fields stripped of their underscore.
  - `LayoutCoordinator._cursorPage` → `cursorPageValue` (backing for the
    public `get cursorPage()`); everything else dropped the underscore.
  - `EditorSurface._state` / `_isDirty` / `_listeners` → `editorState` / `dirty` /
    `listeners`.
  - `SurfaceRegistry._activeId` / `_activeSurface` → `activeIdValue` /
    `activeSurfaceValue` (backing fields for the public getters); other
    private fields dropped the underscore.

  Comment updates: "flow document" / "flow state" wording that was contrasting
  the root editor against active surfaces is rewritten to "root editor
  document" / "root editor state" so the same vocabulary doesn't blur with
  layout's `Flow*` types (`FlowBlock`, `FlowConfig`).

  **Public API is unchanged.** Interface members (`IBaseEditor._applyTransaction`,
  `IBaseEditor._setOwnerMediator`-style cross-class API), layout shape fields
  (`_chromePayloads`), and `EditorSurface._committing` remain `_`-prefixed —
  those are intentional "internal-ish public" signals and migrate separately.

  Other packages: no runtime / API change — bumps included for lockstep
  versioning.

- d508775: **⚠️ Visual behaviour change for `@scrivr/react` menu components — see migration note below.**

  Make the React menu and popover components headless-friendly by removing baked-in visual inline styles, adding stable `data-*` state and part selectors, exposing per-part class name props for consumer styling, shipping an optional `@scrivr/react/styles.css` reference stylesheet that can be overridden by app CSS or Tailwind utilities, and exporting hooks for consumers who want to render fully custom UI.

  **Migration:** the previous inline styles are gone. Consumers who relied on the default look must either (a) import `@scrivr/react/styles.css`, or (b) provide their own styles via the new per-part class name props / `data-*` selectors. This bump is **patch** in keeping with Scrivr's beta-only patch policy (`feedback_changeset_patch_only`); semver discipline begins at the future deliberate 1.0 → 2.0 graduation, not here.

- 972dab2: Double-click the page margin to create a header/footer (Word/Docs UX). Previously, a fresh doc with `doc.attrs.headerFooter === null` had a dead margin area — clicks did nothing and the user had to call `setEnabled(true)` from custom UI or pre-seed a policy to even reach the bands.

  **@scrivr/core**

  - `TileManager`'s `onPageClick` hit test now falls back to `pageConfig.margins.top` / `pageConfig.margins.bottom` when band heights are zero, so the margin strip is always hit-testable. When a real policy is loaded and bands are rendered, the resolved band bounds still win (no regression on documents that already use the chrome bands).

  **@scrivr/plugins**

  - `tableIntegrityPlugin`'s sibling concern in the HeaderFooter extension: the `chromeClick` listener now bootstraps a policy on double-click instead of bailing when `policy` is null/disabled. Single clicks remain a no-op. Force-enables a lingering disabled policy and creates an empty default slot when `differentFirstPage` is set but the first-page slot wasn't seeded.
  - `ensurePolicy()` is now exported from `HeaderFooterController.ts` so the chrome-click handler can reuse the same bootstrap path that the controller's `setEnabled(true)` uses.
  - `addPageChrome.measure()` now reserves a default ghost band (empty paragraph slot) on every page when no policy exists, so the margin strip is visually present before the user clicks. The first margin double-click upgrades the ghost into a real on-doc policy.

  **@scrivr/react / @scrivr/export-pdf / @scrivr/export-markdown**

  - Lockstep version bump only — no API changes.

  **Out of scope (follow-ups):**

  - Hover-state placeholder ("Click to add header" hint text) — Word/Docs do this on hover only. Worth a separate PR once the activation flow is in.
  - Manual playground verification: temporarily comment out `DemoContent` in `apps/docs/src/playground/Playground.tsx` so the policy isn't pre-seeded, then double-click the top margin — header band should appear and gain focus. Body clicks deactivate. Restore `DemoContent` before merging.

- 0a17632: `@scrivr/core`: split the extension lifecycle into engine + view phases.

  **Before:** every extension declared `onEditorReady(editor: IBaseEditor)`
  and either cast to `IEditor` (the documented workaround) or accepted
  `IEditor` directly (silently overriding the parameter type). The result
  was that view-only extensions (Image / TrackChanges / CollaborationCursor
  / AiCaret / GhostText / AiSuggestion / HeaderFooter / PdfExport / etc.)
  would crash at runtime when loaded into `ServerEditor` because the hook
  fired headlessly and reached for `addOverlayRenderHandler` / `redraw` /
  `selection` / `surfaces`.

  **Now:** two hooks, two phases:

  ```ts
  Extension.create({
    onEditorReady?(editor: IBaseEditor) {
      /* engine setup */
    },
    onViewReady?(editor: IEditor) {
      /* view setup  */
    },
  });
  ```

  - `onEditorReady` fires in **both** `Editor` and `ServerEditor` after the
    document engine is ready. Parameter is `IBaseEditor`; only engine APIs
    are reachable. Use for: collaboration document binding, plugin-state
    bootstrap, subscribers, export/markdown setup.
  - `onViewReady` fires **only in browser `Editor`**, after layout / input
    bridge / surfaces / overlay layer are initialised. Parameter is
    `IEditor`; full view surface is reachable. Use for: overlay handlers,
    redraw triggers, selection wiring, layout reads, `setReady`.

  Cleanup fns from both hooks collect in one `runtimeCleanup` array on
  `BaseEditor` and fire on `destroy()` in registration order.

  **Extensions migrated to `onViewReady`** (paint/view-only work that was
  crashing on `ServerEditor` and now simply doesn't run there):

  - `@scrivr/core`: `Image` (redraw on image load), `StarterKit`
    (aggregates Image's view-only setup).
  - `@scrivr/plugins`: `TrackChanges`, `CollaborationCursor`,
    `Collaboration`, `AiCaret`, `GhostText`, `AiSuggestion`, `AiToolkit`,
    `HeaderFooter`.
  - `@scrivr/export-pdf`: `PdfExport`.

  `HeaderFooter`'s and `TrackChanges`'s ad-hoc `isViewEditor` runtime
  guards are removed — the engine guarantees the hook only fires when the
  view is real.

  **Closes** `todo_extension_oneditorready_guard.md` (was tracking the 7
  extensions that crashed on `ServerEditor`; all migrated).

  **New tests:** `packages/core/src/extensions/lifecycle.test.ts` — 6 tests
  prove the contract:

  1. `ServerEditor` calls `onEditorReady` but not `onViewReady`.
  2. `Editor` calls both, in order (`editor` then `view`).
  3. Cleanup from both hooks runs on `destroy()`.
  4. `ServerEditor` only runs `onEditorReady` cleanup on `destroy()`.
  5. A view-only extension that uses `addOverlayRenderHandler` inside
     `onViewReady` loads in `ServerEditor` without crash (no guard, no
     cast — the hook never fires there).
  6. A mixed extension runs engine setup on server and view setup only in
     browser.

  **Plugin authors going forward:** if your extension touches `editor.layout`,
  `editor.addOverlayRenderHandler`, `editor.redraw`, `editor.selection`,
  `editor.surfaces`, or `editor.setReady`, put that work in `onViewReady`.
  If it only touches `editor.getState`, `editor.applyTransaction`,
  `editor.subscribe`, etc., keep it in `onEditorReady`.

  `onEditorReady` and `onViewReady` are both optional — declare neither,
  either, or both per your extension's needs.

  No runtime behaviour change in the browser path. Headless `ServerEditor`
  now loads every built-in / plugin extension without runtime errors;
  view-only setup is silently skipped.

  1,241 / 1,241 tests pass (1,235 baseline + 6 new lifecycle tests).

- 020e362: `@scrivr/core`:

  - New public type `TextMeasurerLike` — the four-method contract
    (`measureWidth`, `getFontMetrics`, `measureRun`, `invalidate`) that the
    layout pipeline consumes. Re-exported from the package entry. Layout +
    rendering signatures (`BlockLayoutOptions.measurer`,
    `BlockRenderContext.measurer`, `LayoutCoordinatorOptions.measurer`,
    `PageChromeMeasureInput.measurer`, `RenderPageOptions.measurer`,
    `MiniPipelineOptions.measurer`, `InlineStrategy.measure`, etc.) widen
    from concrete `TextMeasurer` to `TextMeasurerLike`. Backwards
    compatible — real `TextMeasurer` still satisfies the interface.
  - New `EditorOptions.textMeasurer?: TextMeasurerLike` injection point.
    Production code leaves it undefined and gets the existing DOM-canvas
    default; tests and custom runtimes pass a real `@napi-rs/canvas` or
    other backend.
  - New `TextMeasurerOptions.context?: TextMeasureContext` injection point
    on the `TextMeasurer` constructor. Same purpose: tests inject a real
    Skia ctx so widths and metrics come from a real backend.

  `@scrivr/plugins`:

  - `YBinding`'s constructor `editor` parameter widens from `IEditor` to
    `IBaseEditor`. The binding only uses base-editor APIs (`getState`,
    `subscribe`, `_applyTransaction`), so the narrower interface covers
    both browser `Editor` and headless `ServerEditor`. Backwards
    compatible — existing `IEditor` callers still satisfy `IBaseEditor`.
  - `tokenStrategies` (header-footer) re-types its measurer parameters as
    `TextMeasurerLike` instead of concrete `TextMeasurer`. No runtime
    change.

  Other packages: no runtime / API change — bumps included for lockstep
  versioning.

- 0dec8aa: Tables Phase 2 — `TableMap` + document-validity normalization. Editing operations and the upcoming Phase 3 row/column commands have a stable grid view of any table, and structurally invalid tables produced by paste, collab merges, or buggy authoring are silently repaired before the next render. Tables remain opt-in via `StarterKit.configure({ table: true })`.

  **@scrivr/core**

  - New `TableMap` (`packages/core/src/table/TableMap.ts`):
    - `width` / `height` / `map: number[]` (row-major flat array of cell offsets, `-1` for empty slots).
    - `positionAt(row, col)`, `findCell(cellOffset): Rect`, `cellsInRect(rect)`, `rowSpanAt(cellOffset)`.
    - vMerge chains walked once at build time; `rowSpanAt` is O(1). Broken chains (continue with no preceding restart) are defensively treated as fresh placements so queries still resolve.
    - Identity-cached via `WeakMap<Node, TableMap>` (`getTableMap(node)`); structural changes produce a new ProseMirror Node, which invalidates the cache for free.
  - New `normalizeTables(state): Transaction | null` and `tableIntegrityPlugin()` (`packages/core/src/table/normalize.ts`):
    - Rule 1: clamp `cell.attrs.gridSpan < 1` to 1.
    - Rule 2: `vMerge: "continue"` with no preceding `restart` / `continue` at that column → reset to `"none"`.
    - Rule 3: `table.attrs.grid` shorter than the widest row → extend with default 100px columns.
    - Rule 4: rows narrower than `table.grid` → pad with empty `tableCell > paragraph` cells.
    - Fixed-point loop capped at `MAX_ITERATIONS = 8`; emits a console warning if the cap is hit. Selection-only transactions skip normalization (cheap path).
    - Plugin attaches via the Table extension's `addProseMirrorPlugins()`. Wired through `StarterKit` only when `table: true`.
  - `Table` extension now contributes `addProseMirrorPlugins()` returning `[tableIntegrityPlugin()]`.
  - 36 new tests: 19 covering `TableMap` (rectangular / horizontal merge / vertical merge / combined / cache identity / broken chain), 12 covering `normalizeTables` + `tableIntegrityPlugin` wiring, 5 covering `<table>` / `<tr>` / `<td>` / `<th>` / `<tbody>` parse via the schema's `parseDOM`.

  **Known follow-up:** `appendTransaction` only fires on transactions, so a malformed initial doc loaded via `EditorOptions.content` does not get normalized until the first edit. Phase 5 (`tableEditingGuards`) will likely co-locate an initial-doc normalization pass in `BaseEditor` to close that gap.

## 1.0.8

### Patch Changes

- bc1652d: Two new ways to seed initial editor content: a `DefaultContent` extension that takes either markdown or JSON, and a widened `content` constructor option that accepts strings (markdown) alongside the existing JSON object. Both surfaces share a single parser implementation; the constructor option overrides any extension contribution. Server users typically reach for `new ServerEditor({ content: "# md" })`, kit-builders compose `DefaultContent.configure({ markdown })` into an extensions list — either path lands the same document.

  **@scrivr/core**

  - New `DefaultContent` extension at `extensions/built-in/DefaultContent.ts`. Takes `{ markdown?: string } | { json?: object }` (mutually exclusive — throws on both or neither). Use via `DefaultContent.configure({ markdown: "# Hello" })` or `DefaultContent.configure({ json: docJson })`.
  - `BaseEditorOptions.content`, `EditorOptions.content`, and `ServerEditorOptions.content` widened from `Record<string, unknown>` to `string | Record<string, unknown>`. Strings are parsed as markdown via the merged extension token map; objects keep the existing JSON path. Passing `content` on the constructor overrides any `DefaultContent` (or other `addInitialDoc`) contribution from the extensions list.
  - `addInitialDoc` lifecycle now runs _after_ every extension has fully resolved (previously it ran inside each extension's `resolve()`, before others were known). The hook's `this` context is the new `InitialDocContext` — `ExtensionContext` plus a `parseMarkdown(text)` helper that uses the merged token map. This is what lets the extension seed from markdown without an editor instance. Existing extensions that only used `this.schema` keep working unchanged.
  - New `parseMarkdownToDoc(schema, tokens, text)` helper in `model/parseMarkdown.ts` — the shared core used by `BaseEditor.parseMarkdown`, the constructor `content` option, and `InitialDocContext.parseMarkdown`. `BaseEditor.parseMarkdown` is now a one-line wrapper.
  - New `InitialDocContext` type exported from `extensions/index.ts` for consumers writing custom content-seeding extensions.

  **@scrivr/react**, **@scrivr/plugins**, **@scrivr/export-pdf**, **@scrivr/export-markdown**

  - No code changes. Patch bump only, lockstep versioning.

- 40be274: Tables ship behind an opt-in flag. Phase 1's placeholder render is intentionally not in default `StarterKit` while the layout/render/export pipeline is filled in (Phases 2–4 of `docs/tables.md`). Apps consuming the released packages get unchanged behavior; tables are silent until explicitly enabled.

  **Breaking-ish for early adopters:**

  ```ts
  // Before — default-on:
  new Editor({ extensions: [StarterKit] });

  // After — opt-in:
  new Editor({ extensions: [StarterKit.configure({ table: true })] });
  ```

  **@scrivr/core**

  - `StarterKitOptions.table` flips from `false?` (default-on, opt-out) to `true?` (default-off, opt-in). All five `if (opts.table !== false)` gates in `StarterKit` flip to `if (opts.table === true)` (nodes, commands, layout handlers, toolbar items, markdown serializer rules).
  - `Table` extension and its types (`CellSubBlock`, `LayoutBlockKind === "tableRow"`) remain exported. Power users can continue composing `Table` directly without StarterKit:

    ```ts
    new Editor({ extensions: [StarterKit, Table] });
    ```

  - 3 new regression tests in `Table.test.ts` lock in the contract:
    - default `StarterKit` does not include `table` / `tableRow` / `tableCell` / `tableHeader` in the schema,
    - default `StarterKit` does not expose `insertTable` / `deleteTable` commands,
    - `StarterKit.configure({ table: true })` registers the full schema.

  **@scrivr/react / @scrivr/plugins / @scrivr/export-pdf / @scrivr/export-markdown**

  - Lockstep version bump only — no API changes.

- dad19d0: Tables Phase 1 — schema + insert/delete + placeholder render. Tables can now be inserted, removed, serialised to JSON, and survive page boundaries with a one-bordered-box-per-row placeholder. Real cell layout, cell text rendering, and PDF parity land in Phase 4 (see `docs/tables.md`).

  **@scrivr/core**

  - New `Table` extension with four Word-shaped node specs: `table` (`grid: number[]`, `layout: "fixed"`, `isolating`), `tableRow` (`repeatHeader`, `allowBreakAcrossPages`), `tableCell` and `tableHeader` (`gridSpan`, `vMerge`, `hMerge`, `hAlign`, `vAlign`, `background`, `margins`, `borders`, all `isolating`).
  - New commands `insertTable({ rows, cols })` and `deleteTable()`. Insert places the table after the current top-level block with uniform 100px columns, an empty paragraph in each cell, and parks the cursor in the first cell. Delete walks up to the surrounding `table` ancestor.
  - New `LayoutBlock.cells?: CellSubBlock[]` field and `CellSubBlock` interface (Phase 1: always `[]`; Phase 4 fills it).
  - New `layoutTableRow()` in `BlockLayout.ts` — stub that returns a fixed-height (32px) `kind: "tableRow"` block per row.
  - New `TableLayoutEngine` re-export module (placeholder for Phase 4's full engine) and `TableRowStrategy` placeholder renderer that paints a single 1px gray bordered rectangle per row.
  - `PageLayout.collectLayoutItems()` now expands `table` nodes into one `LayoutItem` per row. Pagination treats `tableRow` as atomic alongside `leaf` blocks: whole rows move to the next page on overflow, and a row taller than the content area clips on the next page (Word's `cantSplit` policy).
  - `StarterKit` accepts `table?: false` and registers Table by default.
  - New `insertTable` toolbar item (▦ icon) inserts a 3×3 table.
  - New markdown serializer rules for `table` / `tableRow` / `tableCell` / `tableHeader`. Phase 1 emits GFM-style pipe tables: first row becomes the header, cells flatten to pipe-escaped single-line text. Block content, marks, and merged cells collapse to plain text (full markdown serializer with merged-cell skip lands in Phase 8). Without this, `getMarkdown()` would throw on any document containing an inserted table since StarterKit enables Table by default.
  - Regression test: `new Editor({ content: { ...table... } })` hydrates the table into the proper `tableHeader` / `tableCell` / `tableRow` / `table` structure. Locks in compatibility with `EditorOptions.content` (added by the DefaultContent extension PR) and confirms the schema round-trips through the constructor's content path.

  **@scrivr/react / @scrivr/plugins / @scrivr/export-pdf / @scrivr/export-markdown**

  - Lockstep version bump only — no API changes. PDF export ignores tables for now (canvas placeholder only); Phase 4 adds the PDF table handler in lockstep with real cell rendering, per the parity rule.

- bf33e14: Theming: 12 canvas tokens + per-extension theme + PDF override path. Tailwind dark mode (or any CSS-variable-driven theme system) can drive both DOM chrome and canvas paint from a single source of truth. PDF export defaults to a print-ready palette that ignores the canvas theme; callers opt into themed PDF via `exportPdf({ theme })`.

  **Note:** This bumps `MarkDecorator`, `InlineStrategy.render`, `OverlayRenderHandler`, `BlockRenderContext`, and `PageChromePaintContext` signatures with new theme/effective-color parameters. Third-party extensions that hook these will pick up TypeScript errors and need to update their signatures (most can ignore the new args; underline/strikethrough-style decorators read `effectiveTextColor`).

  **@scrivr/core**

  - New `EditorTheme` (input — accepts CSS color strings including `var(--token)` references) and `ResolvedTheme` (output — literal colors only, what render contexts consume). Both exported from `@scrivr/core`. 12 tokens cover cross-cutting paint surfaces: pageBg, pageShadow, defaultText, link, cursor, selectionFill, imagePlaceholderBg/Border/Text, listMarker, hrColor, resizeHandle.
  - New constants: `defaultEditorTheme` (matches every hardcoded color used today — zero visual regression for apps that don't pass `theme`) and `defaultPdfTheme` (print-ready palette: white bg, black text, blue link, light placeholders).
  - New `EditorOptions.theme` and `EditorOptions.themeRoot`. `themeRoot` defaults to the mounted container, falling back to `document.documentElement` for unmounted instances. `var(--token)` strings resolve against `themeRoot` via a hidden `<div>` probe + `getComputedStyle` (the browser handles every CSS color form for free — `var()`, `var()` with fallback, `color-mix()`, `oklch()`, `calc()`).
  - New `editor.setTheme(partial)` API. Partial merge with explicit semantics: `null` resets a token to its default, `undefined` leaves the token alone, any other value overrides. Calling with `{}` is a pure refresh (re-resolves and bumps `renderGeneration`).
  - New `editor.getTheme()` and `editor.getResolvedTheme()` accessors.
  - Auto-installed `MutationObserver` on `themeRoot` (watching `class`, `style`, `data-theme`) when any theme value contains `var(`. rAF-coalesced — burst mutations produce one re-resolve per frame. Toggling the Tailwind `dark` class triggers a single canvas repaint without explicit calls.
  - Theme threaded into every paint surface today: `canvas.ts` clearCanvas (pageBg), `TextBlockStrategy` default text fill (defaultText), `Underline`/`Strikethrough` decorations (theme.defaultText — color marks do NOT bleed into decoration color, matching Word/Docs convention), `Link` decorator (theme.link), `Image` placeholders (3 tokens), `HorizontalRule` (hrColor), `ListItemStrategy` markers (listMarker), `ResizeController` handles (resizeHandle), `OverlayRenderer` cursor + selection (cursor, selectionFill), `TileManager` page wrapper (pageBg + pageShadow).
  - `BlockRenderContext`, `PageChromePaintContext`, `MarkDecorator.decoratePre`/`decoratePost`/`decorateFill`, `InlineStrategy.render`, and `OverlayRenderHandler` now carry/receive a resolved theme (and `effectiveTextColor` for mark decorators) so third-party extensions get dark mode automatically without forking the paint contract.
  - `CodeBlock` extension now accepts a `theme: { bg, border }` option for per-extension palette overrides. Other built-ins read from the cross-cutting `ResolvedTheme` directly.
  - `ServerEditor` accepts `theme` and exposes `getTheme()` + `getResolvedTheme()`. Server-side any `var(...)` entries are dropped (warned at construct via `console.warn`) and the rest are merged over `defaultEditorTheme`. PDF callers can pass `editor.getResolvedTheme()` directly into `exportPdf({ theme })` without re-specifying colors.
  - Probe element lifecycle is leak-free across construct → mount → unmount → remount → destroy. The probe is disposed when `_themeRoot` switches (constructor's documentElement → mount's container) and again on destroy. The MutationObserver-driven rAF refresh is tracked + cancelled on unmount/destroy so stray callbacks can't recreate a probe on a torn-down editor.
  - Header/footer surfaces inherit the body's resolved theme via `PageChromePaintContext.theme` — they never store a copy, so `setTheme()` on the body propagates without surface-side refresh.
  - `TileManager` paged-mode page wrapper now reads `pageShadow` and `pageBg` from the active resolved theme on every paint. User-supplied `pageStyle.boxShadow` / `pageStyle.background` overrides still win.

  **@scrivr/export-pdf**

  - New `PdfExportOptions.theme` — `Partial<ResolvedTheme>` (literal CSS colors only). Shallow-merged over `defaultPdfTheme`. PDF default is independent of `editor.theme` so a dark canvas still produces a print-ready PDF unless the caller explicitly opts in.
  - The PDF per-page loop now paints `theme.pageBg` as the first draw call so themed exports actually have the requested background color (pdf-lib's default white was previously visible regardless of theme).
  - `editor.commands.exportPdf({ theme, filename })` accepts the same theme override at the command level. Type-safe via the augmented `Commands` interface.
  - New `parseCssColor` helper supports `#hex`, `#rgb`, `rgb(...)`, and `rgba(...)` formats — used internally to parse theme tokens into pdf-lib `rgb()` colors.
  - `PdfContext.theme` field carries the resolved theme to every PDF handler. Built-in handlers (paragraph/heading/image/hr/codeblock/listItem/underline/strikethrough/link) read from `ctx.theme`; extension-contributed PDF handlers via `addExports().pdf` get the same context shape.

  **@scrivr/react**, **@scrivr/plugins**, **@scrivr/export-markdown**

  - No code changes. Patch bump only, lockstep versioning. Plugins' header-footer chrome paint reads `paintCtx.theme` to render header/footer body content with the same theme as the page body — surface theme parity with no surface-side state.

### Patch Changes

- b9d64c1: Anchored-object yOffset deferred fixes — closes the items left open by the prior yOffset PR. Core gets the architecture work; export-pdf gets paint-order parity; react/plugins/export-markdown bump in lockstep with no code changes.

  **@scrivr/core**

  - **Phase 5 V2 — FlowBlock rip-out for top-bottom.** The `partKind: "anchored-object"` synthetic FlowBlock split (with its `before / image / after` paragraph fragmentation in `buildBlockFlow`) is gone. Top-bottom now contributes a `side: "full"` rect via `addFullWidthRect` and reflows flows through the same `reflowFlowsAgainstExclusions` path as square. One path, one question. Removes `topBottomImageInfo`, the four `anchoredObject*` fields on `FlowBlock`, and the top-bottom `yOffset` suppression hack in `PointerController` that Phase 5 V1 needed.
  - **`zIndex` attribute on image nodes** (default `0`). Two new helpers — `compareAnchoredObjectPaintOrder` (asc by zIndex, then docPos) and `compareAnchoredObjectHitOrder` (paint order reversed) — drive painting in `PageRenderer`/`export-pdf` and hit-testing in `PointerController`. Schema attr round-trips through PM as a normal number.
  - **Cross-page exact-position drop.** `PointerController.commitAnchoredDrag` now resolves the destination `yOffset` against the new anchor's globalY instead of resetting to `0`. The image lands at the cursor position rather than snapping to the new anchor's natural row. Closes the deferred TODO from the prior PR.
  - **Same-page re-anchor with threshold.** `resolveSamePageReanchor` re-parents an image to the closest paragraph when the committed yOffset would shrink dramatically (past `RE_ANCHOR_THRESHOLD_PX = 24`). Without this the offset accumulates across many drags.
  - **Inline image drag overlay.** Inline images now show the same translucent ghost + caret marker as anchored drags, with `disabled = true` styling for in-gap drops. Mirrors the anchored-drag overlay state contract.
  - **`pageStartGlobal` / `pageLocalYToGlobal` lifted to `PageMetrics`** (`pageStartGlobalForMetrics`, `pageLocalYToGlobalForMetrics`, `PageFlowMetrics` type). One implementation, called from both `PageLayout` and `PointerController`.
  - **`pageRectsDigest` invalidates pagination cache** when anchored-object placements change between layout runs. The runFlowPipeline path now drops `previousLayout` for pagination if the digest mismatches.
  - **Magic-number constants extracted.** `DRAG_THRESHOLD_PX`, `AXIS_STILL_THRESHOLD_PX`, `RE_ANCHOR_THRESHOLD_PX` are file-level `const`s in PointerController.
  - **Tests.** New tests for: zIndex paint/hit order helpers (3), pageRectsDigest invalidation (2), same-page re-anchor (2), cross-page yOffset (1). Existing top-bottom tests updated to the unified-rect shape.

  **@scrivr/export-pdf**

  - Paints anchored objects in `compareAnchoredObjectPaintOrder` to match the canvas renderer. Without this, zIndex would silently differ between PDF and on-screen output.

  **@scrivr/react**, **@scrivr/plugins**, **@scrivr/export-markdown**

  - No code changes. Patch bump only, lockstep versioning.

- dc23d63: Default anchored-image margin (wrap-zone breathing room) bumped from `8px` to `12px` to match Word's `~0.13"` Square / Tight wrap default. The previous 8px default left text appearing flush against the image's visible pixels — 12px is closer to Word and visually clearly separates text from the image at typical reading sizes. Documents with an explicit `margin` attr are unaffected.

  **@scrivr/core**

  - `ANCHORED_OBJECT_MARGIN` constant: `8` → `12`.
  - Image schema default in `Image.ts` extension and `model/schema.ts`: `8` → `12`.
  - One affected test updated (`square-left: constrained lines …` — text now starts at `image.right + 12 = 212` instead of `208`).

  **@scrivr/react**, **@scrivr/plugins**, **@scrivr/export-pdf**, **@scrivr/export-markdown**

  - No code changes. Patch bump only, lockstep versioning.

- a958911: New opt-in debug overlay that visualises anchored-object placement state on the canvas. Useful when "the image looks wrong" — paints the exclusion area, the page-edge clamp boundary, and the paint-order metadata that normally lives only in `LayoutPage.anchoredObjects[]`.

  **@scrivr/core**

  - New `AnchoredObjectDebugOverlay.ts` — `installAnchoredObjectDebugOverlay(editor)` registers an overlay render handler that, when `editor.debug.anchoredObjects` is true, paints on every visible page:
    - **Wrap-zone fill** (translucent blue) at the margin-inflated exclusion rect. Square wrap inflates on all four sides; top-bottom inflates top/bottom only and spans the full content width. Behind/front contribute no exclusion and so render no fill.
    - **Clamp outline** (red, 2px) around the painted rect when `placement.clamped` is true.
    - **wrapMode + zIndex label** pinned to the painted rect's bottom-right corner.
  - `DragDebugConfig.anchoredObjects?: boolean` — new config slot, gated by `editor.debug.anchoredObjects`.
  - The overlay is always installed (zero cost when the flag is off); flip the flag at runtime via `editor.debug.anchoredObjects = true; editor.redraw()`.
  - **Tests.** 7 new cases covering: handler registration, no-op when flag is off, paint invocation when flag is on (square + top-bottom + behind/front variants), clamp outline, and per-page filtering.

  **@scrivr/react**, **@scrivr/plugins**, **@scrivr/export-pdf**, **@scrivr/export-markdown**

  - No code changes. Patch bump only, lockstep versioning.

- 4d76706: Anchored-object drag UX hardening + critical drag fix. Core gets the behavior changes; export-pdf gets a type rename to match; react/plugins/export-markdown bump in lockstep with no code changes.

  **@scrivr/core**

  - **Square-right images now draggable.** Fixed `resolveXAlign` legacy shadow bug — `wrappingMode: "square-right"` was overriding explicit `xAlign: "custom"` set by drag commits, so right-flushed images stayed pinned regardless of drop target. Explicit non-default `xAlign` now always wins.
  - **Drag UX hardening.** Edge-band resize handles (12px) so inner image body is reachable for body drag instead of the 8-handle grid stealing every click. Clamp-no-move guard skips no-op PM transactions when drag clamps to source X. Inter-page gap drops are flagged invalid: ghost goes disabled, no transaction dispatched. Cross-page drag onto a virtualized destination falls back to layout-page block scan instead of silently collapsing to docPos 0.
  - **Single source of truth for image rects.** New `editor.getNodeRect(docPos)` reads `layout.anchoredObjects` first (Stage 3 authoritative), falls back to `charMap` for inline images. Resize handles + selection rendering now derive from the same coordinates as body drag.
  - **Drag debug overlay.** New `DragDebugOverlay` paints solver vs charMap rects (green vs yellow) and the page-gap zone (red strip) when `editor.debug = { drag: true }`. `dragDebugLog` emits structured `[drag]` events at down/move/commit/clampedNoMove/gapDrop.
  - **Phase 1b cache invalidation for square wrap zones.** New `flow.overlapsWrapZone` flag stamped during `reflowFlowsAgainstSquareObject`; `paginateFlow` now skips cached-tail reuse when an upstream wrap zone changed. Closes a silent layout-staleness gap when image attrs flip between runs.
  - **wrap-side spec hint.** `docs/anchored-objects/04-edit-ux.md` now documents the v1 wider-side wrap behavior with a tooltip spec for the future Square wrap-mode picker.

  **@scrivr/export-pdf**

  - Renamed `floats` → `anchoredObjects`, `FloatLayout` → `AnchoredObjectPlacement`, and collapsed `mode: "square-left" | "square-right"` to `wrapMode: "square"` to match the core API. Anchor field renamed `anchorBlockY` → `anchorGlobalY`. Internal helper `drawPdfFloat` → `drawPdfAnchoredObject`. No behavior change — pure rename to track the core type surface.

  **@scrivr/react**, **@scrivr/plugins**, **@scrivr/export-markdown**

  - No code changes. Patch bump only, to keep all `@scrivr/*` packages on the same version.

- 85a8aea: Float-image bug fixes, new `PageBreak` extension, and stricter `ToolbarItemSpec` typing.

  **@scrivr/core**

  - **Anchor-only paragraph is never a flow citizen.** Four layers were leaking the orphan empty paragraph that appeared after dragging a float out of its host paragraph; each is now closed:

    - `BlockLayout.ts` — anchor-only paragraphs now bypass `LineBreaker` entirely. `layoutBlock` synthesises a single hidden anchor line directly via `createHiddenAnchorLine`, so the zero-height invariant is preserved even when the paragraph overlaps its own exclusion zone (top-bottom wrap with `skipToY` was the failing case).
    - `PageLayout.ts` — square and top-bottom exclusion rects now clamp `[zoneTop, zoneBottom]` to the float's own page so a float anchored near the bottom of page N can't leak exclusion onto page N+1. Flows track `wrapZonePage`, and `rebreakWrappedLinesWithoutExclusions` re-breaks lines at full width when a wrapped flow's continuation lands on a page with no overlapping float.
    - `Editor.ts` — `moveAndUpdateNode` / `moveNode` now compute a `moveDeleteRange` that swallows the parent textblock when an inline image is the sole child. The drag transaction deletes the husk in the same tx and re-maps `targetPos` through the resulting mapping. Word-style: dragging a float out never leaves an orphan paragraph behind.
    - `SelectionController.ts` — `moveLeft` / `moveRight` consolidated into `_moveHorizontally`. If the next position would land on a non-inline image, a `NodeSelection` is made on the image; if `extend=true`, the navigation skips past the hidden anchor; positions with no `CharacterMap` entry are walked through. The cursor cannot park in a zero-height anchor line.

  - **New `PageBreak` extension.** Layout already supported `pageBreak` (`paginateFlow` branches on `flow.isPageBreak` at PageLayout.ts:1183, `collectLayoutItems` detects `node.type.name === "pageBreak"`), but the active StarterKit schema didn't register the node. The new extension closes that gap:

    - `addNodes` — `pageBreak` as a non-selectable atom block, with `<div class="scrivr-page-break">` round-trip.
    - `addCommands` — `insertPageBreak()` inserts after the current top-level block.
    - `addKeymap` — `Mod-Enter` (Word/Docs convention).
    - `addToolbarItems` — `↵` button in the `insert` group.
    - Wired into `StarterKit` (`addNodes`, `addCommands`, `addKeymap`, `addToolbarItems`) gated on a new `pageBreak?: false` option.

  - **Stricter `ToolbarItemSpec.command` typing.** `command` is now `keyof SafeFlatCommands` instead of `string`, so toolbar items are validated against contributed `Commands<ReturnType>` augmentations. Filled the pre-existing gaps the new type surfaced:

    - `FontFamily.ts` — added `setBlockFontFamily` and `unsetBlockFontFamily` to the Commands augmentation (toolbar was using these untyped).
    - `Heading.ts` — Commands augmentation switched to a mapped type `[K in 1|2|3|4|5|6 as setHeading${K}]: () => ReturnType` so the toolbar's template literal narrows; `HeadingLevel = 1|...|6` exported and `HeadingOptions.levels` narrowed to `HeadingLevel[]`. `StarterKitOptions.heading.levels` updated to match.
    - `Indent.ts` — added the missing Commands augmentation for `increaseIndent` / `decreaseIndent`.

  - **Public re-exports for `CodeBlock`, `HorizontalRule`, `PageBreak`.** These extensions had `declare module "@scrivr/core"` augmentations but weren't re-exported from `extensions/index.ts`, so the augmentations never reached consumers' type graph (consumer apps saw `setHeading1`/`setLink`/`toggleBold` but not `toggleCodeBlock`/`insertHorizontalRule`/`insertPageBreak`). Adding the exports propagates the augmentations and unblocks typed `editor.commands.*` calls in consumer apps.

  - **Tests.** 12 new cases:
    - `BlockLayout.test.ts` — anchor-only paragraph stays zero-height when overlapping its own exclusion zone.
    - `PageLayout.test.ts` — anchor-only paragraph contributes no vertical gap before following text; floats at page bottom don't leak exclusion onto the next page.
    - `Editor.test.ts` — drag deletes the orphan parent paragraph; `moveRight` selects a non-inline image instead of landing in its hidden anchor; `Shift+moveRight` skips a hidden anchor when extending selection.
    - `PageBreak.test.ts` — node registration, atom/selectable flags, command exposure, keymap binding, schema integration, JSON round-trip.

  **apps/docs**

  - Demo content polished: tightened the welcome and Layout Engine paragraphs (less marketing-y, no redundant phrasing).
  - New "Floating Images" section that exercises every wrap mode with text actually wrapping around it: square (left, with surrounding flow), top-and-bottom (full-width, text above and below, plus a contrast-with-square closing line), behind (right, `yOffset: 40`), in-front (left, `yOffset: 30`).
  - A page-break drops the behind/in-front demos onto their own page.

  **@scrivr/react**, **@scrivr/plugins**, **@scrivr/export-pdf**, **@scrivr/export-markdown**

  - No code changes. Patch bump only, lockstep versioning.

- 10ea56e: Anchored images can now extend horizontally into the left or right page margins (Word-aligned). Vertical clamp remains at content bounds — top/bottom margins are reserved for headers and footers, so images cannot extend into them. This narrows a divergence from Word's behaviour; Google Docs allows broader margin overflow including footer/off-page drops, which we explicitly do not adopt.

  **@scrivr/core**

  - **`resolveImageX` accepts `pageWidth` and applies a different clamp per `xAlign`.** Named alignments (`left` / `center` / `right`) still snap to content bounds — the typography convention and Word's default "Margin" horizontal anchor. `xAlign: "custom"` (the user-positioned result of a drag) clamps to page bounds: `[0, pageWidth - imageWidth]`. The image can therefore hang into the left or right margin but cannot escape the page.
  - **`PointerController.resolveDragTargetX` clamps the dragged image to page bounds** instead of content bounds, so live drag feedback matches the new commit behaviour.
  - **Vertical `yOffset` clamp is unchanged** — painted top stays in `[pageStart, pageStart + contentHeight - height]`. Top/bottom margins are reserved for headers/footers.
  - **Tests.** Two new `resolveImageX` cases cover left-margin and right-margin overflow; two existing custom-clamp cases updated to assert page-edge clamping. The "Step 3 — clamp-no-move" drag test is reframed around the page-left edge instead of the content-left edge.

  **@scrivr/react**, **@scrivr/plugins**, **@scrivr/export-pdf**, **@scrivr/export-markdown**

  - No code changes. Patch bump only, lockstep versioning.

- 12e8476: Add an explicit `kind: "text" | "leaf" | "tableRow"` discriminator to `LayoutBlock` and migrate every consumer that previously branched on `lines.length === 0`. Foundation-only change: the `tableRow` variant is reserved for the upcoming Table extension and is not produced by any code path yet — paragraph, heading, list, listItem, image, hr, and pageBreak rendering are unchanged.

  **@scrivr/core**

  - New `LayoutBlockKind` type exported from `BlockLayout.ts`. `LayoutBlock.kind` is now a required field with documented invariants:
    - `"text"` — block has rendered lines (paragraph, heading, list_item, codeBlock; anchor-only paragraphs still qualify because they hold a hidden anchor line).
    - `"leaf"` — block has no inline content (image, horizontalRule, pageBreak, and the inline-atom sub-blocks dispatched by the PDF exporter); `lines` is `[]`.
    - `"tableRow"` — reserved; not constructed yet.
  - `layoutBlock` returns `kind: "text"` for textblocks; `layoutLeafBlock` returns `kind: "leaf"`. The split-path partBlocks in `paginateFlow` are tagged `"text"`.
  - `MeasureCacheEntry` and `FlowBlock` mirror `kind` so the pagination loop and exclusion-reflow pass route on the discriminator without re-probing line counts. Page-break flow markers carry `kind: "leaf"`.
  - Migrated consumers: `paginateFlow`'s leaf-overflow branch and split-path guard, `reflowFlowsAgainstExclusions`, `isAnchorOnlyFlowEntry`, `LayoutCoordinator._indexLayout` and `ensurePagePopulated`, and `populateCharMap` in `BlockLayout.ts`. Each now switches on `block.kind === "leaf"` (or its inverse) rather than `block.lines.length === 0`.
  - All 829 core tests, 15 export-pdf tests, and 311 plugins tests stay green; full typecheck and build are clean across all 12 packages.

  **@scrivr/export-pdf**

  - The inline-atom dispatch in `context.ts` constructs its synthetic atom block with `kind: "leaf"` and drops the prior `as LayoutBlock` cast in favour of a typed annotation. PDF rendering output is unchanged.
  - Test fixtures in `buildPdf.test.ts` carry the new field (`kind: "text"` for `paragraphBlock`, `kind: "leaf"` for `hrBlock`).

  **@scrivr/react**, **@scrivr/plugins**, **@scrivr/export-markdown**

  - No code changes. Patch bump only, lockstep versioning.

- 3e5ec8f: Closes the double-click rapid-drag race condition: while a drag is in flight, a second `mousedown` is now ignored. Without this guard, an accidental double-click during drag could fire two PM transactions from a single user gesture, or resolve text selection at a stale point.

  **@scrivr/core**

  - `PointerController.handleMouseDown` returns early when any drag is active (`isDragging`, `resizeDrag`, `anchoredDrag`, or `inlineImageDrag`). The guard releases on `mouseup` so a fresh gesture can start cleanly. Equivalent to `setPointerCapture` + `pointerdown` ignore — we use mouse events so the guard is explicit.
  - **Tests.** Three new cases in `PointerController.dragUX.test.ts § Step 9 — pointer capture during drag`: anchored-drag re-entry, resize-drag re-entry, and post-mouseup re-acquisition.

  **@scrivr/react**, **@scrivr/plugins**, **@scrivr/export-pdf**, **@scrivr/export-markdown**

  - No code changes. Patch bump only, lockstep versioning.

- 9be941a: Segment-based wrap exclusions. Square-wrap text now flows through every available segment around an anchored object instead of picking one side. Core gets the layout refactor and a latent-bug fix; react gets a UI consolidation; export-pdf gets the renderer-side equivalent. Plugins and export-markdown bump in lockstep with no code changes.

  **@scrivr/core**

  - **Multi-segment line layout.** `LineBreaker` swapped its single-rect `ConstraintProvider` for a true `LineSpaceProvider` returning `AvailableSegment[]`. A visual line can now span multiple segments — text on both sides of a square-wrap image is filled left-to-right within one line. Lines carry `{ positioned, segments? }` instead of the old `{ constraintX, effectiveWidth }`.
  - **`ExclusionManager` is the single source of rect math.** `PageLayout.reflowFlowsAgainstSquareObject` now populates an `ExclusionManager` and queries `getAvailableSegments`, replacing the inlined subtraction helper that had drifted from the manager implementation.
  - **Schema: `wrapText` attr removed.** The per-image `largest | left | right` wrap-side override is moot now that both sides are usable simultaneously. Existing documents with `wrapText: "left"` etc. parse fine and silently lose the override (no migration needed — visual outcome is just both-sides wrap from now on).
  - **Latent bug fix in `blockHasAnchoredObject`.** The cache-invalidation predicate was reading legacy `wrappingMode` only. Combined with the new ImageMenu writing `{ wrapMode, wrappingMode: "inline" }`, anchored images set via the new menu were misclassified as inline. Now reads through `normalizeImageAttrs` so canonical and legacy attrs both resolve.
  - **Tests:** `ExclusionManager.test.ts` covers `getAvailableSegments` and `getNextFreeY`. `PageLayout.test.ts` asserts that segmented lines preserve word order across the exclusion hole (no drops or duplicates).

  **@scrivr/export-pdf**

  - Renderer skips alignment / justify offsets when `line.positioned`, since segmented lines carry final absolute span x values. Removed an `as`-cast that had been working around a stale type import.

  **@scrivr/react**

  - `ImageMenu` collapses `square-left` + `square-right` buttons into a single `square` toggle — the wrap-side preference is no longer meaningful with segment-based exclusions. `resolveWrappingMode` shims legacy persisted values.

  **@scrivr/plugins**, **@scrivr/export-markdown**

  - No code changes. Patch bump only, to keep all `@scrivr/*` packages on the same version.

- 331160e: Delete the legacy `table` / `tableRow` / `tableCell` node specs from `schema.ts`. They predated the Table extension plan, used an incompatible `columnWidths` attr, and lacked `isolating` / `parseDOM`. The forthcoming Table extension (Phase 1 step 4+ of `docs/tables.md`) will be the single source of truth for table schema.

  **@scrivr/core**

  - Removed the `table`, `tableRow`, `tableCell` node specs from `model/schema.ts`. No code path produces or consumes these nodes today — verified by grep across the monorepo.
  - Updated `model/schema.test.ts` to drop the table nodes from the required-types list and remove the `columnWidths` attr assertion.
  - Documentation (`CLAUDE.md`, `packages/core/README.md`) updated to reflect the trimmed node list.
  - Regression sweep per `docs/tables.md` Phase 1 step 3: paragraph/heading/list/listItem/image/hr/pageBreak rendering unchanged. All 842 core tests, 15 export-pdf tests, 311 plugins tests, 12 export-markdown tests green; full typecheck clean across all 12 packages.

  **@scrivr/export-pdf**, **@scrivr/react**, **@scrivr/plugins**, **@scrivr/export-markdown**

  - No code changes. Patch bump only, lockstep versioning.

- 0d419b7: yOffset Phase 1: structural placement attribute for anchored images. Default `0` is a no-op — pre-Phase-1 documents render identically. Spec: `docs/anchored-objects/06-yoffset-redesign.md`.

  **@scrivr/core**

  - **New image attr `yOffset` (default `0`).** Vertical placement delta from the anchor flow's globalY. `imageRect.y = anchorFlow.globalY + yOffset` is now the single source of truth for paint, exclusion rects, hit-test, and PDF — every consumer reads from `placement.x/y/width/height/page`, no recomputation from anchor flow Y.
  - **`AnchoredObjectPlacement` gains `globalY` and optional `clamped`.** `globalY` is the painted top in continuous global-Y coordinates (= `anchorGlobalY + yOffset`, post-clamp). `clamped: true` is set when the user-set `yOffset` was clamped to keep the image on its anchor's page — Phase 2's drag overlay will read this for the boundary indicator. `anchorGlobalY` keeps its meaning (anchor flow's globalY); the Phase 2 drag snapshot reads it.
  - **Page-edge clamp (V1).** `image.page === anchor.page` is a hard invariant. A `yOffset` that would paint the image off the anchor's page is clamped silently in layout (Phase 2's drag overlay surfaces stickiness visually).
  - **Square-stacking math now uses painted bottoms.** `PageLayout` previously stacked the next square image against the prior placement's _anchor flow_ bottom; under non-zero `yOffset` that re-creates the "moves visually but wraps old location" bug class. Switched to `placed.globalY + height + margin`. Identical behavior when all `yOffset` values are 0.
  - **Square exclusion rect uses painted Y.** `reflowFlowsAgainstSquareObject` is fed the painted `globalY`/`localY`, so text wraps the image's actual position rather than its anchor flow row.
  - **Legacy `floatOffset.y` migrates to `yOffset` on read.** A non-zero `yOffset` is authoritative; the schema-default `0` falls back to `floatOffset.y` so legacy documents keep their vertical placement. New code should write `yOffset` directly.
  - **Tests.** `AnchoredObjects.test.ts` covers the `yOffset` migration table (default, explicit, legacy fallback, malformed `floatOffset` shapes). `PageLayout.test.ts` asserts `yOffset=0` is a no-op, `yOffset=40` shifts paint together with anchor preserved, legacy `floatOffset.y` produces the same painted position as new `yOffset`, page-edge clamp sets `clamped` and pulls overflow back onto the page (positive and negative), and square-stacking respects painted bottoms.

  **@scrivr/react**, **@scrivr/plugins**, **@scrivr/export-pdf**, **@scrivr/export-markdown**

  - No code changes. Patch bump only, to keep all `@scrivr/*` packages on the same version. PDF export already reads `placement.x/y/width/height/page`, so it picks up `yOffset` for free through the layout layer.

- 0d419b7: yOffset Phase 2: drag commits `yOffset`, anchor stays put. Anchored images can now be dragged anywhere on their page without parenting to a different paragraph. Spec: `docs/anchored-objects/06-yoffset-redesign.md` § Phase 2.

  **@scrivr/core**

  - **`PointerController` drag rewrite.** At pointerdown we snapshot the anchor flow's globalY, the image's painted globalY, and the current `yOffset` from `placement.anchorGlobalY` / `placement.globalY` (Phase 1 fields). The snapshot is frozen for the gesture's lifetime — drag math never reads live layout, so vertical drag no longer feeds back into the anchor position.
  - **Same-page drag → `setNodeAttrs({ xAlign, x, yOffset })`.** Pure attr update; the image's docPos doesn't change. The user-visible behavior is the one the redesign was about: "drag an image anywhere on its page and it stays put — the anchor doesn't drift to another paragraph because the cursor passed over one."
  - **Cross-page drag → `moveAndUpdateNode({ ..., yOffset: 0 })`.** Anchor relocates to a paragraph on the new page in one transaction; `yOffset` resets so the image lands at the new anchor's natural position. (Preserving exact visual position across the page break — adjusted yOffset against new anchor's globalY — needs a `pageStartGlobal` helper not yet exposed to PointerController; deferred to a follow-up.)
  - **Y_THRESHOLD = 3px on same-page commits.** Mirrors the existing horizontal threshold. A "pure horizontal" drag with natural mouse jitter (≤3px Y wobble) doesn't write a spurious `yOffset`.
  - **Tests updated.** `PointerController.test.ts` and `PointerController.dragUX.test.ts` switched from the old commit matrix (moveAndUpdateNode for diagonal, moveNode for vertical) to the new one (setNodeAttrs same-page, moveAndUpdateNode cross-page). Pure-horizontal tests now use `dy=0` to assert that `yOffset` is omitted when there's no vertical intent.

  **@scrivr/react**, **@scrivr/plugins**, **@scrivr/export-pdf**, **@scrivr/export-markdown**

  - No code changes. Patch bump only, lockstep versioning. Drag UX is core-side; React just mounts the renderer.

- 349da18: yOffset Phase 3: anchored-image height stops contributing to paragraph height. An image-only paragraph now reserves one default-font line of vertical space instead of inflating to the image's full height. Spec: `docs/anchored-objects/06-yoffset-redesign.md` § Phase 3.

  **@scrivr/core**

  - **`BlockLayout`'s empty-node fallback widens from "renderable" to "non-zero".** Previously the ZWS injection only fired when no spans existed (or only `kind: "break"` spans). Now it also fires when every span is a zero-size object sentinel — i.e. a paragraph whose only content is one or more anchored images.
  - **Sentinel preserved alongside ZWS.** When zero-size object sentinels are present, the ZWS is **appended** rather than substituted, so `getAnchoredObjectAnchors` still finds the image's docPos via `flow.lines[].spans[]`. Empty / break-only paragraphs keep the old substitute-with-ZWS behavior — no behavior change for those.
  - **Result.** Image-only paragraph now has `block.height ≈ MOCK_LINE_HEIGHT` (default font line) rather than `block.height = imageHeight`. Inline images are untouched (their non-zero size keeps `hasNonZeroContent` true). Phase 1 invariant _"`paragraph.height === text.height` (no image contribution)"_ is now true for the empty-anchor case too.
  - **Tests.** `BlockLayout.test.ts` adds four Phase 3 tests: (1) image-only paragraph collapses to default font line, (2) sentinel is preserved on the line, (3) text + non-inline image keeps text line height, (4) inline image still inflates as before.

  **@scrivr/react**, **@scrivr/plugins**, **@scrivr/export-pdf**, **@scrivr/export-markdown**

  - No code changes. Patch bump only, lockstep versioning.

- aef1835: yOffset Phase 4: square reflow shares one `ExclusionManager` per page. Multi-image-on-same-flow now wraps against the union of all rects rather than the last one. Spec: `docs/anchored-objects/06-yoffset-redesign.md` § Phase 4.

  **@scrivr/core**

  - **`resolveAnchoredObjects` owns a `Map<pageNumber, ExclusionManager>`.** When a square anchor is processed, the rect is added to the page's shared manager _before_ the reflow call. Subsequent square anchors on the same page accumulate into the same manager, so flows that overlap multiple images see the union of all rects via `getAvailableSegments`.
  - **`reflowFlowsAgainstSquareObject` → `reflowFlowsAgainstSquareExclusions`.** The function no longer creates its own `ExclusionManager` or calls `addRect`. It receives the shared manager and a `{ pageNumber, zoneTop, zoneBottom, contentX, contentWidth }` zone for early-exit bounds. The `lineSpaceProvider` queries the manager directly so each line sees every rect added so far on the page.
  - **Latent bug fix.** Two square images in the same paragraph (or in adjacent paragraphs with overlapping wrap zones) used to corrupt subsequent text wrap: the second reflow's single-rect query returned segments around image B only, overwriting the first call's result and silently positioning text underneath image A. The shared manager fixes this by construction. Tracked as `todo_anchor_stacked_reflow.md`.
  - **Iteration semantics preserved for the common case.** Sequential anchors in document order — the realistic workload — re-iterate downstream flows against the current manager state, so adding a rect always reflows everything below it. Pathological out-of-document-order overlaps (anchor A late in the doc with a yOffset that places its rect above anchor B earlier in the doc) are not handled by this iteration; that's a Phase 4 follow-up if it appears in real documents.
  - **Cache invalidation deferred.** Spec calls for a `pageRectsDigest` to widen the per-flow `overlapsWrapZone` cache key; this PR keeps the existing flag (set when a flow's Y intersects the current zone) and accepts that flow caching can stale when an image rect moves under yOffset. Will land in a follow-up.
  - **Tests.** New `PageLayout.test.ts` test: two square images (`xAlign: "left"` and `xAlign: "right"`) on the same page with a long text paragraph below — text spans are asserted to fall entirely between the two rects' painted edges, not beneath either image.

  **@scrivr/react**, **@scrivr/plugins**, **@scrivr/export-pdf**, **@scrivr/export-markdown**

  - No code changes. Patch bump only, lockstep versioning.

- 2189983: yOffset Phase 5 (minimal): top-bottom anchored objects contribute a `side: "full"` rect to the page's shared `ExclusionManager`. Architectural unification — all wrap modes now feed one manager. Spec: `docs/anchored-objects/06-yoffset-redesign.md` § Phase 5.

  **@scrivr/core**

  - **`ExclusionManager.addFullWidthRect(...)` helper.** Closes the spec's correctness gap on `side: "full"` rects: a manually-set `addRect` with `side: "full"` but `x` / `right` narrower than the queried content area silently leaves side segments, which makes `getAvailableSegments` drop the `skipToY` (segments.length ≠ 0 → skipToY suppressed in the return). The helper takes `{ page, y, bottom, contentX, contentWidth, docPos }` and forces the rect to span the content bounds — the failure mode is unreachable.
  - **Top-bottom rects flow into the page-level manager.** In `resolveAnchoredObjects`, when `wrapMode === "top-bottom"`, the placement now also contributes a full-width rect via `addFullWidthRect`. Square reflows on the same page therefore see top-bottom bands as real exclusions through the same manager that drives square wrap — Phase 4's per-page `ExclusionManager` now holds rects for _every_ anchored wrap mode.
  - **Scope choice — minimal V1.** The spec also calls for ripping out the `partKind: "anchored-object"` `FlowBlock` splitting in `buildBlockFlow` so top-bottom and square share the layout-pipeline path entirely. That rewrite forces test rewrites (8+ existing tests assert the image lives as its own layout block separated from "before" / "after" text fragments). Deferred to Phase 5 V2; the current FlowBlock splitting still positions the image vertically for the no-overlap-with-square common case. The user-visible win — top-bottom and square interacting cleanly through one manager — lands now; the structural rip-out is a separate change.
  - **Tests.** New `ExclusionManager.test.ts` tests: (1) `addFullWidthRect` produces `skipToY` for overlapping queries, (2) demonstrates the failure mode the helper prevents (manual `addRect` with mismatched bounds suppresses `skipToY`).

### Patch Changes

- 36a7776: **@scrivr/react** — Add `readOnly` option to `useScrivrEditor` hook. Reset `letterSpacing`, `wordSpacing`, `textTransform` on the `<Scrivr>` container to prevent host app CSS from causing cursor drift.

  **@scrivr/core** — New `Indent` extension with block indent (`Mod-]`/`Mod-[`, 0-8 levels at 24px each) and first-line indent (`textIndent` attr in px). Both inherited on Enter split, parsed from paste, serialized to DOM. Expose `getMarkdownParserTokens()` and `parseMarkdown(text)` on `BaseEditor` for server-side markdown parsing.

- 88016a6: Add LICENSE file and README to all packages. Add missing `license` field to export-pdf, export-markdown, and export-docx package.json files.
- ddd1448: Allow mouse selection (click, drag, double/triple-click) in readOnly mode so users can select and copy text. Block programmatic command dispatch (`editor.commands.*`) in readOnly to prevent extensions from bypassing InputBridge.

## 1.0.5

### Patch Changes

- f6950b5: Add token authentication and connection lifecycle callbacks to the Collaboration plugin and collab server.

  **@scrivr/plugins** — `Collaboration.configure()` now accepts `token` (string or async function) forwarded to HocuspocusProvider for WebSocket auth, plus optional `onConnect`/`onDisconnect` callbacks for connection lifecycle visibility.

- 0f6d00a: Fix cross-page selection highlight and cursor fallback for float-only pages
- ff7390f: Split `@scrivr/export` into `@scrivr/export-pdf` (pdf-lib) and `@scrivr/export-markdown` (prosemirror-markdown) so each format carries only its own deps. The original `@scrivr/export` becomes a compat shim that re-exports from both — existing consumers keep working.

  Add `addExports()` extension lane to `@scrivr/core` with the `FormatHandlers` augmentation pattern. Format packages declare their handler shape via module augmentation; extensions contribute format-tagged handlers via `addExports()`. Handler interfaces are placeholders until the M2 export dispatch refactor fills them.

  Dependent packages bumped to pick up the new export extensibility types.

- a198d0f: Add HeaderFooter extension with configurable headers and footers, live inline editing, token substitution, and PDF export parity.

  **@scrivr/plugins** — New `HeaderFooter` extension: doc-level `headerFooter` policy, per-page slot resolution (`differentFirstPage`, `differentOddEven` reserved), `pageNumber`/`totalPages`/`date` inline atom tokens with dynamic `measure()`, headless `HeaderFooterController` for building settings UI, surface-based live editing with undo/redo history, restricted schema (no tables/page breaks), and PDF chrome + token export handlers.

  **@scrivr/core** — Surface-aware command routing (`_getActiveState`/`_dispatchToActive`), `chromeClick` event, `PageChromePaintContext` gains `measurer`/`markDecorators`/`blockRegistry`/`inlineRegistry`, `ChromeContribution` gains `replacesTopMargin`/`replacesBottomMargin`/`topBandStart`/`bottomBandStart`, `EditorSurface` accepts plugins, `IEditor` exposes `surfaces`/`invalidateLayout`/`getPageScreenPosition`, `InlineStrategy` type exported from layout index, and `addCommands` signature widened to support typed command parameters.

  **@scrivr/export-pdf** — Chrome payload image scanning for `embedImages`, WinAnsi sanitizer expanded to cover smart quotes and em/en dashes.

  **@scrivr/react** — New `HeaderFooterRibbon` component (Google Docs-style ribbon bar with "Different first page" toggle, margin controls, token insert buttons, and remove header/footer actions).

- 8ccf3ea: Add `EditorSurface` + `SurfaceRegistry` + `addSurfaceOwner()` extension lane for multi-surface document editing. Plugins can now register plugin-owned edit regions (headers, footnote bodies, comment threads) that own their own `EditorState` and participate in a full activate/commit/deactivate lifecycle. Body (flow doc) remains the default active surface — `activeId === null` — and `editor.state` always returns flow state regardless of activation. Zero user-visible change. Enables the upcoming HeaderFooter plugin to ship fully editable in-place rather than paint-only.

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- c963158: Add standalone `getSchema()` function for building a ProseMirror schema from extensions without instantiating an Editor. Standardize all node/mark type names to camelCase (`tableRow`, `hardBreak`, `fontSize`, `fontFamily`, `trackedInsert`, `trackedDelete`, etc.) for a consistent naming convention across the schema.
- 5752be2: Picks up image interaction and popover UX fixes from `@scrivr/core` — no React-level changes. See the `@scrivr/core` changelog for details.

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 914daad: ### Editing UX improvements

  - Double-click to select word, triple-click to select paragraph, with word-granularity drag extension
  - Platform-specific keyboard shortcuts: Option/Ctrl+Arrow word navigation, Cmd/Home/End line start/end, Cmd+Up/Down doc start/end, Option/Ctrl+Backspace/Delete word delete — all with Shift variants for extending selection

  ### Crisp rendering

  - Pixel-snap all overlay rectangles (selection, tracked changes) to the device pixel grid — eliminates antialiasing seams between adjacent rects
  - DPR change detection via matchMedia + Visual Viewport API — canvases repaint at correct resolution on browser zoom, display switch, and pinch-to-zoom

  ### Architecture

  - **New:** `SelectionController` — extracted from Editor, owns all cursor movement, word/line navigation, and selection logic. Accessed via `editor.selection`
  - **New:** `PointerController` — extracted from TileManager, owns all mouse interaction (hit testing, click counting, drag tracking)
  - **Breaking:** `editor.moveCursorTo()` and other navigation methods removed from Editor — use `editor.selection.moveCursorTo()` instead
  - **Breaking:** `ViewManager` deleted (was deprecated, replaced by TileManager). Remove any `ViewManager` imports

- Updated dependencies [1d7dde7]
  - @scrivr/core@1.0.2
  - @scrivr/plugins@1.0.2

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 4b0e9c0: Add README.md to all packages with installation instructions, API overview, and usage examples. Fix root README to reference the correct hook name (`useScrivrEditor`) and renderer (`TileManager`).
- f4442e8: feat(core): addDocAttrs() extension lane for doc-level attributes

  Extensions can now contribute attributes to the `doc` node via a new `addDocAttrs()` Phase 1 hook:

  ```ts
  const HeaderFooter = Extension.create({
    name: "headerFooter",
    addDocAttrs() {
      return { headerFooter: { default: null } };
    },
  });
  ```

  `ExtensionManager.buildSchema` merges contributions from every extension into the doc node spec. Two extensions contributing the same attr name is a collision and throws at schema-build time with an error naming both owners — extensions are expected to namespace their attr names to avoid collisions in practice.

  Once declared, attrs are writable via ProseMirror's built-in `tr.setDocAttribute(name, value)`, which routes through `DocAttrStep` (jsonID `"docAttr"`, shipped in `prosemirror-transform` since 1.8.0). `@scrivr/core` now re-exports `DocAttrStep` as a convenience — extensions don't need to import from `prosemirror-transform` directly.

  This is the foundation for PR 4's HeaderFooter extension and future footnotes / comments / page-settings extensions that need document-level metadata participating in undo/redo, history snapshots, and collaboration round-trips.

- 3dcb134: refactor(layout): per-page PageMetrics, runMiniPipeline, recursion guard

  Internal refactor to `@scrivr/core`'s layout engine. Zero behavior change — all 566 tests pass unchanged.

  ### New primitives

  - `PageMetrics` — per-page geometry bundle (contentTop, contentBottom, contentHeight, contentWidth, header/footer heights). Replaces raw `margins.top` / `pageHeight - margins.bottom` arithmetic throughout the pipeline.
  - `computePageMetrics` — pure function deriving PageMetrics from PageConfig + chrome reservations.
  - `ChromeContribution` / `ResolvedChrome` — types for future chrome contributors (headers, footers, footnotes).
  - `fitLinesInCapacity` — shared line-fitting primitive extracted from paginateFlow's split loop.
  - `runMiniPipeline` — measurement-only pipeline for mini-documents (headers, footers, footnote bodies). Safe to call from chrome contributor hooks without triggering recursive pagination.
  - Recursion guard on `runPipeline` that throws with a readable error pointing at `runMiniPipeline`.

  ### Refactored hot paths

  - `paginateFlow` reads all vertical positions through `metricsFor(pageNumber)` instead of raw margin arithmetic (10 call sites).
  - `applyFloatLayout` uses `metricsForPage` helper across 9 call sites (float placement, exclusion re-layout, overflow cascade).
  - `DocumentLayout` gains optional `metrics[]`, `runId`, `convergence`, `iterationCount` fields.
  - `MeasureCacheEntry` gains `placedRunId` / `placedContentTop` for the early-termination guard to detect chrome configuration changes between runs.
  - `EMPTY_RESOLVED_CHROME` is `Object.freeze`d to prevent accidental mutation.

  ### Test coverage

  566 tests passing (555 pre-existing + 11 new covering PageMetrics, fitLinesInCapacity, runMiniPipeline, and the recursion guard).
